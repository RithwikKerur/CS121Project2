    				Economic gains are limited in India    			


After having visited Gurgaon and other places and seeing great buildings and shopping malls in India, I was very pleased about economic gains in India.  Today I read a very sobering article in Times of India.
According to latest figures, about one third of poors in the world live in India and the number (percentage) of poor people was reducing in late part of last century but has been increasing during the period of the so called economic reform during the last 15 years.  More than 42% of Indians live below the international poverty line — below $1.25/day.
After reading this all those glittering buildings and malls appear to be only the part of the so called contrasts in Indian society — a few ‘best’ among lots of ‘worsts’.

Just back from  Oakbrook Mall  – things do seem to be picking up. Are others feeling the same?
