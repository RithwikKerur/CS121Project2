    				Hawaii Vacation — photos    			


I squezzed out a mini vacation (a weekend +) in Hawaii during my trip to serve on a panel at ICASSP.
Here are several photos in Seraja.Â  http://www.seraja.com/event/639597
Â By the way, Seraja has much improved tools for uploading photos and for finding related events now.Â  The site is very useful now.
