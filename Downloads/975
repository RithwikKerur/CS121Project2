Newsworks: “It takes a ‘learning hero’ to break out of the education pipeline” (Ito featured)




Who is your learning hero? Who would you say has been an inspirational person in your life who has unlocked new ideas and pushed you to learn?
Cultural anthropologist Mizuko “Mimi” Ito asked that question when she spoke last month at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University about technology use, and how the ways in which kids’ relationship with media and communication is changing might lead to innovations in education. Her presentation was part of an ongoing project of Drexel’s ExCITe Center, called “Learning Innovation.”

Connected Camps: “How to Get Your Daughters into Tech by Embracing Who They Really Are” by Mimi Ito

April 5, 2017


Only 26% of computing professionals are women, which is down from 36% in 1991. Millions of dollars are being spent on closing this gender gap, but it persists. Even though girls are just as into math and science in their school years, few go onto major in these areas, and even fewer go on to tech careers. What can we do to help our daughters buck these odds? Girls and Minecraft offer important hints.

BBC: “Meet the people who’ve stopped emailing”

April 4, 2017


The idea, say those who are eschewing email, is to have more time for other types of work and communication.
