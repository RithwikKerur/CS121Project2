    				iPod for Print    			


NYT has an interesting article by David Carr that discusses how time has come when a new way to distribute print is required to advance this industry:
The newspaper business is in a horrible state. It’s not that papers don’t make money. They make plenty. But not many people, or at least not many on Wall Street, see a future in them. In an attempt to leave the forest of dead trees and reach the high plains of digital media, every paper in the country is struggling mightily to digitize its content with Web sites, blogs, video and podcasts. 
And they are half right. Putting print on the grid is a necessity, because the grid is where America lives. But what the newspaper industry really needs is an iPod moment. 
This is a clear opportunity which needs some technological innovation, but seems something that is no onger a science fiction.
