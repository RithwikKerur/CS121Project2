Workshop 


Week 10: Hour of Code 

 12/15/201312/19/2013admin




Monday, December 2nd, WICS organized an Hour of Code workshop that targeted undecided/undeclared majors at UCI. Over 20 students interested in coding not only got to learn how to code but also socialize and have some fun before finals week.
In celebration of Computer Science Education Week, WICS assisted students in learning the basics of code through simple and creative online tutorials. Multiple difficulty levels of tutorials were provided and allowed students of any background to play around and experiment within the hour. Students also had a chance to socialize with WICS members outside the computer lab with provided snacks and drinks.
WICS would like to thank everyone for coming to this event right before Finals. There will be future workshops similar to this one, don’t miss out!
