    				Quality of Experience    			


Every time I hear about length of experience, I start wondering is length really a good measure for experience.
Just because I sleep thru a situation, does not mean that I have knowledge of the situation or insights in it.
SO people shold define some other measure for talking about experience.
For example, if Hillary Clinton wants to claim that she is more experienced compared to Barack Obama, she should bring in more concrete aspects related to her and Barack’s quality of experiences — not just the length.
Similarly in technology, we should develop some more concrete ways for measuring quality of experience than what is done in quality of service.
