My Research Interests
I am interested in applied statistics, and have published
most extensively on the use of statistics in parapsychology. 
I am also interested in statistics education and literacy. 
I have provided some of the most commonly requested papers here. 
In the Fall of 1995 Professor Ray Hyman (University of Oregon)and I prepared a report
assessing the statistical evidence for psychic functioning in US government sponsored research.
The report was part of a review done by the American Institutes of Research
(AIR) at the request of Congress and the CIA. It received wide-spread media coverage. 
My report and related reports: 

An Assessment Of The
     Evidence For Psychic Functioning
Professor Hyman's
     report.
Utts' reply to
     Hyman's report
Response by Dr. Edwin May,
     the lead investigator for the government-sponsored work and Director, Cognitive Sciences Laboratory

"Replication and Meta-Analysis in Parapsychology." 
(Statistical Science, with commentary by others) - summarizes some of
the statistical evidence for psi phenomena that was available at the time the
paper was written (1991).
