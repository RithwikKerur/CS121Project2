Seminar Series
Select Fridays from 2-3 p.m. during the academic year, the department organizes a Friday seminar, for which it typically brings in outside speakers. All seminars are open to anyone who wants to attend. The seminars are an excellent opportunity to be inspired by what others are doing, learn about the state of the art and interact with influential researchers from across the world. Please check back for seminar updates as scheduling changes throughout the quarter. The seminars are held in Donald Bren Hall 6011 and streamed live on Zoom using Meeting ID 959 1727 1554.
