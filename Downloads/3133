    				Back after fires    			


Well, I was not affected by fires, but somehow my blog stopped working — it would let me see everything except updating it.  So I was away from the blog.  My systems people, Thanks Hans, tell me that it was due to some incompatibility in the PHP and were wondering how it has been working.  In any case, I am now able to be back on line.
San Diego fires were really bad this time.  But things are back to more or less normal now.  We did not get affected — except having Neil, and Swati family with us — which was a good by-product.  And luckily, they were also not affected.
