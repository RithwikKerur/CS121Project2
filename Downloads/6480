Abstract

        Leveraging synthetically rendered data offers great potential
        to improve monocular depth estimation,
        but closing the synthetic-real domain gap is a non-trivial and
        important task.
        While much recent work has focused on unsupervised domain adaptation,
        we consider a more realistic scenario where a large amount of
        synthetic training data is supplemented by a small set of real
        images with ground-truth.
        In this setting we find that existing domain translation approaches
        are difficult to train and offer little advantage over simple
        baselines that use a mix of real and synthetic data. A key failure
        mode is that real-world images contain novel objects and clutter not
        present in synthetic training. This high-level domain shift
        isn't handled by existing image translation models.
      


        Based on these observations,
        we develop an attentional module that learns to identify and remove
        (hard) out-of-domain regions in real images in order to improve
        depth prediction for a model trained primarily on synthetic data.
        We carry out extensive experiments to validate our
        attend-remove-complete approach (ARC) and find that it
        significantly outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods
        for depth prediction. Visualizing the removed regions provides
        interpretable insights into the synthetic-real domain gap.
