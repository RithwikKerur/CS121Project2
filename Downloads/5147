Fall 2021 Week 4: Resume Workshop 

 10/22/2021admin



On Monday, October 19, 2021, WICS held a Resume Workshop to help students polish their resume in preparation for recruiting season. Representatives from Amazon, Cisco, CrowdStrike, Northrop Grumman, Plaid, Taco Bell, and Zillow were split into small breakout rooms with students. The representative walked through three resumes, in the order of weakest to strongest. As they went through them, they pointed out its pitfalls, such as grammatical errors and poor formatting. They emphasized the importance of articulating impact in the experience description. Participants were also free to ask questions as well. This was an informative and helpful workshop!
