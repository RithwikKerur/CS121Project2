 What is PmWiki?
 PmWiki is a wiki-based system for collaborative creation and maintenance of websites. See PmWiki.

 What can I do with it?
 PmWiki pages look and act like normal web pages, except they have an "Edit" link that makes it easy to modify existing pages and add new pages into the website, using basic editing rules. You do not need to know or use any HTML or CSS. Page editing can be left open to the public or restricted to small groups of authors. Feel free to experiment with the Text Formatting Rules in the "Wiki sandbox". The website you're currently viewing is built and maintained with PmWiki.

 What are the requirements?
 See the PmWiki requirements page.

 Where can I find documentation?
 See the documentation index page.

 How can I download PmWiki?
 See the download page.

 How do I install PmWiki?
 Instructions for installation are on the installation page.

 How do I get help with PmWiki?
 See Mailing lists and How to get assistance.

 How do you pronounce "Michaud"?
 "Michaud" is french pronounced "mee show", the trailing D is silent.
