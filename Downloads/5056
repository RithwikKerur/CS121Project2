WICS Fall Quarter Week 4: Honey Information Session 

 10/23/201911/13/2019admin



On Monday, Oct 21th, company representatives from Honey hosted an information session about their company and opportunities available this upcoming summer.  Many of the representatives graduated from UCI, including WICS alumni Brooke Ly. They emphasized how they focus on work life balance, diversity, and the mentorship and growth of their employees.  The opportunity mentioned was their software engineering internship based in LA for both part time and full time. During this internship you will be able to work under a focus of technology such as frontend, mobile, backend, infrastructure and much more. Also at the end of their presentation, there was a Q&A portion, where if a WICS member asked a question, they would get a free Honey shirt.  Thanks to Honey for hosting this event and all the attendees for coming out!
