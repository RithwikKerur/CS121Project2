    				Internet, cameras, and politics    			


In an interesting report on News.com the future of politics in the coming days was discussed by some prominent people.
“The benefits of that empowerment are so overwhelming the concerns that everyone has, that it’s a much better world as a result,” Schmidt asserted confidently. But Friedman raised the oft talked about possibility that when the MySpace.com generation starts running for office, there will be a whole Internet full of political liabilities left over from their younger days.
“George Bush never could’ve been elected president if he’d been at Yale now and there’d been cell phone cameras around,” Friedman said, alluding to the commander in chief’s alleged college partying days.
In the days when everybody could be a citizen journalist and when people will share their youth with the world, it will be interesting to see what kind of meansures society will bring and what direction ethics will take.
