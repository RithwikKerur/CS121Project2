    				Immersive World Cup Football    			


Wolfgang Mueller (from Germany, University of Bamberg) sent me the following:
While reading the newspaper, I stumbled over this, and just in case you
have not heard about it, yet:

So immersive technology is being used for the World Cup Football.  My lab at UCSD developed this technology in mid 1990s and Takeo Kanade at Carnegie Mellon developed similar technology.  In fact Takeo demoed this technology for the Super Bowl in Miami, I believe in 2001.  Similar technology was used in movie Matrix.
Slowly this technology is getting ready for wider deployment.  Will be fun.
