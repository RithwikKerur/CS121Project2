    				Busy time    			


End of the quarter and working on a large proposal and getting ready to go to Singapore and India — all these and the regular activities can definitely keep you very busy.  This is busy time, but exciting time.
I am learning a lot in doing the proposal.  It is always interesting to work with people in creating new ideas for a large ambitios proposal.
