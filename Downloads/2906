    				Pattern Recognition    			


Â  Do you see a pattern? by ZDNet‘s Esther Dyson — What’s beyond current search technology? A lot, and most of it has to do with pattern recognition. Come see some patterns with me…
Esther Dyson is a brilliant thinker who is on top of the start-up companies.Â  In the above post she talks about pattern recognition as it applies to ‘words’ used in search engines.Â  More interesting world exists beyond words where symbols are not well defined.Â  That world is becoming incresingly important as image, video, and audio search is becoming essential in the cyberspace.Â  Hopefully she will talk about that world in her future posts.
