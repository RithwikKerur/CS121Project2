    				Finding is better than searching    			


WSJ has a very nice piece on search by Gordon Crovitz.
I particularly liked:
It’s hard to imagine a more useful area for innovation in the world of information than improving search. That’s the first place we look for information on the Web, and the Web has become the first and often last place we look for answers. However the race for the best search engine turns out, the Web will be a better place for the competition.
