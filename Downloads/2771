You should also check out Watson, an implicit search application from Intellext [http://www.intellext.com].
Watson takes a mashup approach and combines an implicit search generator with information from existing sources including Google Desktop Search, Yahoo! News, Technorati blog search, etc. 
Plus Watson doesn’t have the negative privacy implications of Pico; while Pico uploads all your documents to the blinkx server, Intellext’s application does its calculations client-side so your private documents never leave your computer.

I will definitely play with Intellext and share my experience with people.
