Faculty and Staff


The MHCID program is housed in the Department of Informatics at UC Irvine, a leading department in the intersection of people, design, and technology. The department is home to four ACM fellows, four members of the CHI Academy, four endowed chairs, and numerous winners of other prestigious awards. The MHCID program draws faculty members from a myriad of backgrounds to create a rich environment in which students can draw upon a wide range of expertise. Faculty come from across UCI and from industry. Students in the MHCID program will have the opportunity to interact closely with these faculty and with the prestigious members of our industry advisory board.
