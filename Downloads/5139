Spring 2021 Week 5: PennyMac – How to Write a Professional Email Workshop 

 06/04/2021admin



On Monday, April 26th, a recruiter from PennyMac went over tips on how to write a professional email. We learned that emails should be friendly, pleasant and informative with important information clearly, and concisely presented in bullet points. We also learned the differences between cc and bcc and how to vary your tone depending on who you’re writing to. The recruiter also shared interesting stories about writing emails when aggravated or emotional and advised that we stay rational and calm when writing emails, since they can last forever.
