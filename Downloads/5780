The Verge: “﻿Gamergate Comes to the Classroom” (Bo Ruberg quoted)

August 21, 2019


			
[Bo] Ruberg, a UC Irvine assistant professor in the department of informatics, was teaching “Games & Society.” It was November 2017, and the course was a required class taught to 260 students, the majority of which are typically male freshmen. Ruberg kept a strict no-screens policy in their classes — an easy enough ask to keep students from texting or scrolling through Instagram when they should be paying attention. But this was different: a dozen or so people holding up their phones, recording their lecture on gender without even the effort of hiding it.

Informatics Ph.D. Student Jazette Johnson Receives Community-Based Research Fellowship

August 19, 2019



The mission of the Newkirk Center for Science & Society, established nearly 20 years ago with an endowment by Martha and James Newkirk, is to “improve science’s response to community needs and to increase the effective uses of scientific information for the benefit of society.” In support of that mission, the center offers yearlong Community Based Research (CbRI) Fellowships to UCI graduate students from all disciplines. Recently, informatics Ph.D. student Jazette Johnson learned she had been named a CbRI Fellow for the 2019-2020 year, starting Sept. 15. As a fellow, Johnson will receive $5,000 and will work with a local community partner.

Inc.: “You Could Be Your Own Biggest Interruption. Here’s How to Stop and Find Your Focus” (Gloria Mark cited)

August 12, 2019


How often does your attention wander at work due to interruption? According to one study by Gloria Mark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, workers spend on average only 10 minutes and thirty seconds on a task before being interrupted.

The New Yorker: “Was E-Mail a Mistake?” (Gloria Mark quoted)

August 6, 2019


E-mail was supposed to make our work lives easier and more efficient, but the mathematics of distributed systems suggests that meetings might be better.

Gillian Hayes Appointed Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division

July 12, 2019


On behalf of Chancellor Gillman, it is my privilege to announce that Gillian R. Hayes has been appointed vice provost for graduate education and dean of the Graduate Division, effective Sept. 1, 2019.
A member of the UCI faculty since 2007, she currently serves as the Robert A. and Barbara L. Kleist chair in Informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences, with additional appointments in UCI’s School of Education and School of Medicine. Her research interests involve a range of disciplines and a focus on leveraging innovative information technologies to support vulnerable populations.

The Atlantic: “The Slackification of the American Home ” (Melissa Mazmanian quoted)




 Melissa Mazmanian, an informatics professor at UC Irvine, agrees. “The way that we imagine knowledge work and more and more kinds of work is really about coordination and collaboration across distance, across people’s different time commitments, managing attention, figuring out who’s going to do what when,” she says. “And that style of work … It’s very similar to family life, if you think about it.” Perhaps one’s children and direct reports are not so different after all.

Wired: “Reddit’s ‘Manosphere’ and the Challenge of Quantifying Hate” (Katherine Lo quoted)

July 10, 2019


As Katherine Lo, a researcher at UC Irvine who studies online content moderation, points out, datasets are the language many decisionmakers speak. Relying on datasets to determine policies isn’t without its limitations. “The biggest problem is that it’s hard to condense experience into a dataset,” Lo says. Most of the research that’s been done on online harassment and misogyny has used Twitter data because it’s far and away the most accessible.

Wired: “Waze Data Can Help Predict Car Crashes and Cut Response Time” (Sean Young quoted)

July 8, 2019


That almost-three minutes of lead time might not always be the difference between life and death, says Sean Young, a professor of medicine at UCLA and UCI who serves as the executive director of the University of California Institute for Prediction Technology. But “if these methods can cut the response time down by between 20 to 60 percent, then it’s going to have the positive clinical impact,” he says. “It’s generally agreed upon that the faster you get into the emergency room, the better the clinical outcomes will be.”

Capitalizing on the Capstone Experience

June 25, 2019


Capstone courses give students the opportunity to put their skills to the test by letting them work with local organizations to solve real-world problems. The two-quarter Informatics 191 A and B Senior Design Project course in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) presents a win-win situation, as hands-on learning for the students can result in practical solutions for the sponsoring company. For a few students and companies, however, the benefits extend even beyond impressive portfolios and innovative prototypes.
