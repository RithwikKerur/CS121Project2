Title: Data Crowdsourcing: Is It For Real?
Abstract: Crowdsourcing refers to performing a task using human workers that solve subproblems that arise in the task. In this talk I will give an overview of crowdsourcing, focusing on how crowdsourcing can help traditional data processing and analysis tasks. I will also give a brief overview of some of the crowdsourcing research we have done at the Stanford University InfoLab.
