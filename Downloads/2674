    				A site combining Taxonomy and Folksonomy    			


It was an obvious thing to happen.  So in response to a quote from my recent post related to taxonomy and folksonomy in a post by Rajesh on emergic.org, it was brought to our attention that there is newly launched sports video company  called broadbandsports.com that tries to combine this.  You may want to check it out.

Thanks for the plug, Ramesh.
BroadbandSports.com employs a very basic classification system, based on â€œsportsâ€? and just a few well-defined subcategories.  We believe a hybrid is the best approach, especially as we are dealing with a clear and generally narrower community, in which we have had lots of experience, both professionally and personally.
We also employ both a “narrow” and “broad” folksonomy, allowing both video contributors and the community at-large to tag content.
In this way, we address the problem of finding and adequately â€œdescribingâ€™ the contents and or â€œmeaningâ€? of video programming.
