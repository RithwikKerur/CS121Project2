On Monday, February 7 2022, WICS held a virtual Corporate Game Night and invited company representatives to play games and socialize with WICS members. Students, alumni, and representatives went into breakout rooms and played games like shellshock.io, escape rooms, Jackbox, skribbl.io, and puzzles! It was a fun chance to relax and meet some new people during midterm season!
