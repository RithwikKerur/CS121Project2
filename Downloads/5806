“Automation and Heteromation: The Future (and Present) of Labor” by Bonnie Nardi

May 16, 2017


People are already “working alongside machines”—but they are not getting paid for it, or not very much. The debate over automation is a false battle between AI and people—when in fact the critical issue is that the terms of labor are radically changing.

Newsworks: “Kids thrive when they swim among peers and mentors with common interests” by Mimi Ito

May 12, 2017


Often education is conceived of as a “pipeline,” where we push kids along a set path from kindergarten, to elementary, high school, and so on. But when we talk to young people and really look at where and how they learn, and who they learn with, it looks more like a network.

NBC News: “How to Prevent Interruptions at Work” (Mark quoted)

May 10, 2017


Stop interrupting yourself. Stop putting all the blame on Joan from down the hall … you’re just as much to blame for the interuptions. “What fascinates me is that people interrupted themselves almost as much as they were interrupted by external sources,” said Gloria Mark, associate professor at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, who conducted a study on workplace interruptions. “They interrupted themselves about 44 percent of the time.” Indulging the urge to check in on social media or responding to a text message are internal sources of interruption you may not even be aware you are committing.

Interactions: “Health information technology: Opportunities abound. Challenges Remain” by Yunan Chen

May 5, 2017


From electronic health records to personal health apps, information technology (IT) has proliferated in the healthcare sector over the past few years. This has led to the increased availability of electronic data and the improved capability of clinical decision making. Most notably, consumer-facing applications—mobile health apps, wearable devices and sensors, and assistive technologies—have become prevalent, reshaping the landscape of patient education, health management, and public-health practices. It is therefore not surprising that designers and researchers are optimistic about the prospects of health IT. Many firmly believe these innovations represent a powerful source of disruption that will fundamentally change how healthcare is practiced.

Dourish publishes The Stuff of Bits

May 4, 2017


Chancellor’s Professor of Informatics Paul Dourish has published a new book titled The Stuff of Bits: An Essay on the Materialities of Information about the digital representations that help shape our computerized existence.
On one end of our digital experience are interactive virtual entities like online stores, e-books and whole virtual worlds. On the other end are the physical infrastructures that support them, such as fiber optic cables and server farms. The Stuff of Bits examines the domain between these virtual and physical entities that make up our computer-generated experiences and focuses on these digital representations encoded into software, loaded into computer memory, shared between networks and stored in our databases.

Mic: “Racist and sexist behavior in esports is exposing what regular gamers experience every day” (Kat Lo quoted)




In recent months, several professional gamers in the esports world have been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons: incidents of sexual harassment, abuse of power and horrifyingly explicit racist rants.
It’s easy to read these high-profile stories and think they’re strange, one-time occurrences — but for those who play games online, these displays of toxic masculinity are an everyday reality. And if you don’t fit the stereotype of a gamer — meaning you’re not a straight, white male — these racist, sexist and homophobic online encounters with total strangers are much more likely to occur. 
So, what effect do these more high-profile incidents have on the gaming world at large? Do they spark change within communities or simply model bad behavior that normal gamers will be all too eager to emulate? We spoke with Kat Lo — a Ph.D. student and researcher in online communities and harassment at University of California, Irvine — to suss it all out.

Motherboard: “There’s No Safe Way to Keep Child Porn and Murder Off Facebook” (Kat Lo quoted)




“Content moderation is a necessary but limited solution,” Kat Lo, a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine who is studying online communities and moderation, told me. “The fact that Facebook is adding 3,000 more content moderators is great for Facebook consumers but the fact is you’re subjecting a lot more people to something we’ve seen as very traumatic.”

Informatics Ph.D. student introduces DanceCraft to OC autistic children

April 10, 2017


In February, informatics Ph.D. student Kate Ringland teamed up with Broadway choreographer and UCI Assistant Professor of Drama Andrew Palermo to create DanceCraft, a software program that is part of a six-segment dance study on autism.
“It started as a project for Autism App Jam one year and we realized there was real potential for good in it,” said Ringland. “I worked with a great team of undergraduates to build DanceCraft. It’s been an important side project for me.”
Dance can help children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with body awareness, one of several sensory atypicalities associated with ASD.
