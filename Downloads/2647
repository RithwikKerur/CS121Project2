    				Web2.0  Buzzwords    			


Web2.0 has attracted Attention of several people.  Tim O’Reilly’s paper on this topic has been the most ‘defining document’, but still there are so many apects to Web2.0 that this is like that famous ‘six blind men and the elephant’ situation.  In my class on entrepreneurism, I gave a simple home work to students to describe what is Web2.0 and its implications to an entrepreneur and the society.   When I got their reports, I decided to collect all the ‘buzz words’ that I saw there.  Here are those buzz words — I am sure you know many of them, if not most or all.  Some of these are their interesting impressions or opinions.  No particular order — I just scribbled them as I was reading their papers.
Collective intelligence â€“ wisdom of crowds
Software as service
Data is King

Users as co-developers
