    				Aggressiveness in Start-ups    			


NYT reports on a new start up in the area of a brand new approach to Video-on-demand for movies.Â  Sounds very interesting.Â  But the thing that caught my eyes, particularly was the comments made by Brad Stone anout entrepreneurs in the Silicon Valley.Â  The following is a big difference in thinking among really ambitious people and people who want to just be ‘me too’Â  and that is true in all fields.Â  Something to think about:
Insiders familiar with Vuduâ€™s hidden magic say that this 41-employee start-up has everything weâ€™ve come to expect from Silicon Valley: a daring business plan, innovative technology and entrepreneurs prone to breathless superlatives when discussing their new offeringâ€™s possible impact on the world.
Modesty is virtue, but your belief in the effectiveness of your work has to come out if you want people to follow you.Â  I often see people who want to raise lots of money — say $15M — and are afraid to say that they will be a business that will go beyond average businesses.Â  In these cases, why would anybody else take risk and go with you.Â  Obviously, they did not have as much time as you had to think about the impact of your business.

Hi Ramesh,
I absolutely agree on that. I think it is not always to find the right balance and the approach will be depend on your audience as well. 
Kind regards
Marc

Finding a good way to market a business is very important.  It is interesting however to see statistical data on the long term effects of high quality products versus high quality marketing.  Which of the two is more lasting?  Although marketing can give the initial push, perhaps it is the quality that makes a business last.

I agree with you. If a business can’t get investors to see their vision then the the vision is short lived.
