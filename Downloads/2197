Capstone Projects


Capstone projects occur over the final six months of the program and are focused on bringing together all of the skills and knowledge developed throughout the project. Project teams work together to solve a variety of user experience challenges in nearly any domain (education, the environment, healthcare, retail, and more) working with an external client. Iterative research, design, development, and evaluation are the keys to success in the capstone projects. All projects are presented during the Summer Finale at the end of the program.
If your company is interested in sponsoring a capstone project, please email the MHCID director at mhciddirector@ics.uci.edu for more information.
