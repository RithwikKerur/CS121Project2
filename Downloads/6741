										I am currently a PostDoc at University of California, Irvine (UCI) in the Secure Systems and Software Laboratory by Professor Michael Franz.
										 Before that, I've been employed at SBA Research, an inter-university research center partly owned by the University of Technology in Vienna (TU Wien).
My PhD thesis there focused on security and privacy issues in large-scale infrastructure, such as cellular networks (e.g., fake base stations, IMSI catchers), power grids, botnets, and side channels in browsers. In my Master's thesis written at SecLab, I focused on several RFID systems ranging from an electronic purse to a metropolitan size locking system. There, I had the opportunity to be on the winning iCTF team in 2006 and 2011, where I co-organized the team in 2011-2013.
From March to June 2013 and September 2014 to January 2015, I visited the Echizen Group at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo. 
I'm holder of the IEEE Austria Diploma Thesis Award and was nominated for the Distinguished Young Alumnus Award of the Faculty of Informatics, UT Vienna.  My ACSAC 2014 paper won the Best Student Paper Award. 
     

Before that and during my studies, I was a part-time teacher at HTL Spengergasse, a secondary technical high school in Vienna. I'm also founding member of Innoc ('Happylab' Hackerspace), Robotchallenge and Funkfeuer Wien. 
Furthermore I was involved in Roboat, an autonoumous self steering sailing vessel. Other robots of mine where on display at Roboexotica, at Deutsche Technik Museum in Berlin (for an IETF event), and for the "long night of museums" at Technisches Museum Wien. I was speaker at several CCC and a SIGINT congresses as well as on B-Sides and appeared in several national and international media reports after describing how to intercept wireless police cameras on Schwedenplatz in Vienna. I lectured at several BEST Summer Courses in Vienna and Bratislava on various robotic topics. In 2013, I was speaker at the European Forum Alpbach during the technology symposium days.   
Additionally, I held talks at 20c3, 21c3, 22c3, 23c3, 25c3, 30c3, SigInt, B-Sides Vienna, Troopers 2014, CCS2014, ACSAC2014, DayCon 2015, Troopers 2016, DeepSec 2016 and 2017, and others.

Occasionally, I make humoristic t-shirts for conferences or another one or just for fun.

Misc


Some of my very early high-school or pre-studies projects also showed some impact. My Nokia data cable reverse engineering project from 2000 was featured in the book Hardware Hacking: Have Fun while Voiding your Warranty. The original site of my project has been down for years, but I still get requests and questions about it.
My Erdős number currently is 5 (that's bad!). My Kevin Bacon number is 3 (when including TV appearances).
