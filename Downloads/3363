    				Real Virtuality    			


MOst of virtual reality has trued to create audio-visual worlds around a user.  This has been very successful in many applications.
But the real world is brought to us through our five senses: vision, audio, smell, taste, and touch.  Much of the research and technology has been concerned with audio, video, and (lately) touch.  Now Prof. David Howard of York University and Prof. Alan Chalmers of Warwick University are experimenting with what they call Real Virtuality in which they will bring all fives senses to you.
I have not heard of any earlier efforts in which somebody tried to bring all these together.  It appears that they were to present their prototype on March 4th.  I am eager to find more about this research effort.
