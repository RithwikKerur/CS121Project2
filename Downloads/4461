COST & FINANCIAL AIDFeesThe newly revised amounts for the 2021-2022 academic year will be posted in late summer and can be found on the Registrar’s website. Please note all MCS students are automatically charged for and enrolled in the UC Graduate Student Health Insurance Plan.  If you are covered by another health insurance plan that complies with UC’s waiver criteria, you may apply for a waiver.Please note that the compulsory campus-based fees included in the total estimated compulsory campus-based fees are estimated.  Actual compulsory campus-based fee amounts will be adjusted annually for the calendar-year California Consumer Price Index for Urban areas (CA CPI-U) and for any newly implemented campus-based fees as voted by student referendum.  All future fees levels, including, but not limited to compulsory campus-based fees and GSHIP, are estimates and the university may impose additional fees.Covid-19Some or all instruction, for part or the entirety of the academic year, may be delivered remotely depending on the coronavirus situation. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the academic year.FellowshipsFellowships are available to domestic and international students based on academic merit, as well as financial need. Fellowships are also available to students who strengthen our commitment to diversity and under-representation in Computer Science.  A separate fellowship application is not required; fellowship recipients are selected for fellowships by our faculty during the admissions review process.  Financial AidFor information on financial aid and scholarships, please visit the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships website.  Please also review their helpful information on estimated budgets for new graduate students.
