    				Welcome to my blog at UCI    			


Welcome to my blog at UCI.  I will be sharing my views on Experiential Computing and Next Generation Search here.  Occasionally, I will share with you some of my personal events and my philosophy also.  Please feel free to send me your comments and suggestions either publicly or privately.
Some of you have been sharing my views at my blog at Georgia Tech.  A warm welcome here at University of California, Irvine, my new professional home.  I am looking forward to have good exchange of ideas with you in areas of our shared interests.
Thanks for your interest.
