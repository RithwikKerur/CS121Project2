June 28, 2017 In the May 10 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) meeting “Saving Power in the Data Center”, Marios Papaefthymiou, professor of computer science and dean of the UCI Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) showed how redesigning the internal architectures of high performance computer chips can increase their energy efficiency, which can translate to saving significant amounts of power in data centers that rely on myriads of such chips. Papaefthymiou’s research is in energy-efficient architectures for high performance computing.He co-founded Cyclos Semiconductor, a developer of energy-efficient resonant clocking technologies that enable high-performance computing with drastically reduced power consumption.
