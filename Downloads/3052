    				Social Networking Platform    			


Facebook is trying to become a social networking platform:
At the core of Facebook’s new plans is the debut of Facebook/f8, a platform that allows anyone to build applications for social computing. The company is hoping that its 23 million monthly users and the opportunity to create for-profit businesses will attract developers to build a host of new networking services on top of the f8 infrastructure.
In their effort to catch-up with MySpace, FaceBook is providing a platform to developers to build social networking tools easily by using FaceBook.Â  An interesting idea.Â  This should help many start-up companies build their consumer base using some strengths of FaceBook.
