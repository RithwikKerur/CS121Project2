WICS Fall Quarter Week 2: Meet the Board Social + Q&A 

 10/12/201910/23/2019admin



On Friday, October 11, 2019 WICS hosted an informal social for general members that were interested in applying to WICS Committee. All 12 of our board members and a few of our current WICS committee members gathered at University Town Center to meet interested applicants. We broke off into groups according to the different subcommittees in WICS (Executive, Corporate, Community Outreach, and Marketing) so that general members can talk to the subcommittees that they are interested in. We had the absolute pleasure of meeting and connecting with 20-30 potential new committee members! We’re especially excited that so many freshman came out to see us. Committee applications close on Friday, November 8th and we will be welcoming selected applicants at the beginning of Winter Quarter in January!
