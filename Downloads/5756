Edutopia: “How Fan Fiction Can Do Wonders for Student Writing” (Rebecca Black quoted)

February 8, 2022


As a medium, fan fiction gives students the liberty to alter existing worlds or create new ones where they can build upon stories or topics that excite them.
The genre also allows students who are still learning about the elements of a good story to “jump right into a preexisting world, and they can really just attend to things about plot and characterization and create new characters without having to do all those other world-building aspects,” says Rebecca Black, a former high school teacher and now professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who has studied the impact of fan fiction on adolescents and English learners.

January 14, 2022


As more people got mobile devices, responding to messages anytime became the norm among co-workers as well as friends and loved ones. The superpower morphed into an obligation. This is an evolution that Melissa Mazmanian, an informatics professor at UC Irvine refers to as the “spiral of expectations.” … Now, when people feel they haven’t responded sufficiently quickly, they think they owe their correspondent an apology.

Mashable: “College prep software Naviance sells advertising data on millions of students” (Roderic Crooks Interviewed)




Another study, conducted by University of California, Irvine [Informatics Assistant] Professor Roderic Crooks, examined how students in a Los Angeles high school that was 94 percent Latino and 6 percent Black responded to the introduction of Naviance and a school mandate that they use the platform to apply to at least four colleges. He found that students rebelled against software-enabled surveillance of the application process, in some cases uploading fake applications to Naviance in order to meet their quotas and avoid expulsion.
