    				SigGraph Asia    			


SigGraph Asia was in Singapore in the last week — the first SigGraph Asia.
Good start.  Nice to see this conference start in a very vibrant part of the world.  I saw the list of papers and went to the exhibits.  Clearly a long way to go to become close to SigGrpah, but a very good start.
