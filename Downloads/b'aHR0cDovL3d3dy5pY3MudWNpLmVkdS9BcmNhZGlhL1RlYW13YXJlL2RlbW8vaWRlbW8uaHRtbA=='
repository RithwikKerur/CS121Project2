Online Interactive Teamware Demo



Welcome to the Online Interactive 

Teamware
Demo!  This demo is an overview of the demonstration of the Teamware
system that will be given at the 

1995 Software Technology & Intelligent Systems Symposium (STISS).
(View demo in landscape mode for best effect).  This online demo
allows the user to browse the menu and control structure of
the Teamware system.  


This is the initial Teamware Control Panel.  From this window, the
System Programmer, Process Programmer, and End User have access to the
tools and editors necessary for building and executing processes,
browsing and developing categories, and maintining project agendas.

NOTE: These pages are not image mapped because not all buttons have
interfaces associated with them and there is no feedback to the user
from button images.  Also, this demo only contains information about
the Teamware system as is currently implemented.  For more information 
about the system, please refer to the 

teamware page. Also, more 'interactivity' to come...
