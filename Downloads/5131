WICS Fall Quarter Week 3: Amazon “Ace Your Interview” Workshop 

 11/06/2020admin



On Thursday, October 29th, 2020 of Week 3, Amazon hosted an “Ace Your Interview” workshop. Kenny Huynh, a software development engineer at Amazon (and also UC Irvine alumni!) spoke to us about what the online assessment and interview process was like at Amazon. We were able to learn more about Amazon’s Leadership Principles, culture, and generally what interviewers are looking for in a technical interview. During the second half of the workshop, we were also able to do a practice coding assessment together! Many of us are currently recruiting for internships or full time positions, so this workshop was such a big help for us!
