LSM-based storage techniques: a tutorial

January 24, 2020 @ 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm 





« Scalable Programming: Progress, Prospects and Challenges (CS/NetSys Seminar)
A Theoretical View of Distributed Systems (CS Distinguished Seminar Series) »









Speaker: Chen Luo
Abstract: Recently, the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) has been widely adopted for use in the storage layer of modern NoSQL systems. Because of this, there have been a large number of research efforts, from both the database community and the operating systems community, that try to improve various aspects of LSM-trees. In this tutorial, I will describe the basics of LSM-tree storage techniques as well as exploring their design space and performance trade-offs. If time permits, I will also survey some representative work on optimizing LSM-trees.
