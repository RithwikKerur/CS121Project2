The New Yorker: “Death by Flaming Water Ski, and Other Misfortunes” (Bowker quoted)

December 2, 2015


The United States is, by the federal government’s own admission, the last major industrialized nation to adopt the I.C.D.-10. Still, its expansiveness does not trouble everyone. “There are thousands of words in the dictionary,” Donna Pickett, a C.D.C. classifications administrator, told me. “No one uses all of them at the same time—some are archaic and may never be used. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you take the words out.” Proponents note that many sections of the previous edition were lacking. Ebola didn’t have a code, and new advances, such as some types of laparoscopic surgery, had to be shoehorned in under old categories. The I.C.D.-10 allows for greater precision, which is good news for epidemiologists. Geoffrey C. Bowker, an informatics researcher at the University of California, Irvine, praises it for the same reason. What if you wanted to research hazards in a specific sort of gathering place? “We want to know what happens in opera houses,” Bowker said. “We want to know if there’s a particular kind of danger that’s associated with attending the opera, which I can’t particularly imagine, apart from boredom.”

Time: “Company bans email for 1 week, Employee stress levels plummet” (Mark quoted)

November 12, 2015


A 2012 study from the University of California, Irvine found that people who were unable to access email for five days were not only more productive, they had “more natural, variable heart rates.” Over at the Atlantic today, Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, said people check their email on average about 77 times per day, and it’s the checking of email (rather than writing) that is most stressful.
View the full story on the Time website.





The Atlantic: “Is email evil?” (Mark quoted)




According to Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, … “The more email people do, the lower is their assessed productivity, … [and] the lower is their positive mood at the end of the day.” … “I just think we have to rethink email, and even redesign the way email is used,” Mark said in Codebreaker’s first episode.

We are hiring!

Tenure-Track Faculty Position
Digital Games and Interactive Media
The Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine is seeking exceptional candidates for a tenure-track position in digital games and interactive media. We recognize the importance of digital games and interactive media to society and the economy, and wish to complement our existing areas of excellence with a strong presence in these emerging areas.
The department is strongly interdisciplinary, with faculty backgrounds in anthropology, computer science, engineering, humanities, media arts, organizational studies, and psychology. This, in no small measure, contributes to our strong international reputation as an innovative site for research and education on information technology and its applications. We wish to add a similarly interdisciplinary perspective on digital games and interactive media, their role in society, and new possibilities for innovative design.
Our search is intentionally broad. We appreciate work of all varieties, whether empirical, technological, methodological, or analytical in nature. Game technologies, games studies, games and learning, AI for games, games for health, procedural content generation, games and digital media, augmented and/or mixed reality gaming, virtual worlds, game design, and critical game-making are all examples of topics well within the scope of the search.
For three years in a row, UC Irvine has been ranked as the best U.S. university under 50 years old by Times Higher Education.  In 2015, it was ranked the #1 green university by Sierra Magazine in its sustainability report on U.S. colleges and universities, and was ranked the #1 school in the nation in doing the most for low-income students by The New York Times.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in a relevant field and exhibit a compelling research portfolio as well as a clear vision for teaching.  Senior applicants should also demonstrate a proven track record in funded research activities. Salary and other compensation (including priority access to on-campus faculty housing) are competitive with the nation’s finest public universities.
Each application must contain: a cover letter, CV, up to three key publications, a statement of research and teaching interests, and 3-5 letters of recommendation.  A separate statement that addresses past and/or potential contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion must also be included.  All materials must be uploaded at:
https://recruit.ap.uci.edu/apply/JPF03177
The position is approved at the Assistant Professor level, though exceptional candidates at all ranks will be considered.
The position is for appointment in July 2016.  Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, although maximum consideration will be given to applications received by January 8, 2016.
The University of California, Irvine is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer advancing inclusive excellence. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, age, protected veteran status, or other protected categories covered by the UC nondiscrimination policy.





San Jose Mercury News: “Facebook seeks to conquer the workplace” (Mark quoted)

September 30, 2015


Even though Facebook at Work looks identical to a person’s personal Facebook, it’s meant solely for communicating with co-workers, which could make users think twice about what they’re posting.
“People will be more careful about what they post because they know it’s going to be surveilled. There’s also probably a fear by some people that you don’t want to use Facebook too much in the workplace because you’ll be perceived as not doing your job,” said Gloria Mark, an informatics professor at UC Irvine.
