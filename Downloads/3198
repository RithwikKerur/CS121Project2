Thanks for sharing the information.
We at Deutsche Telekom AG Laboratories demonstrated a similiar image recognition based application with a cell phone client at IFA 2007, Berlin.

Funny that our competitor presents it now on the next big german exhibition. Anyway, I’m quite impressed that already have a deal with the tabloid newspaper BILD!

Yes, the press works in its own ways.
By the way, this has been a general area that has seen interesting talks and is slowly coming to the stage where things may in fact become practical.
See my post: http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/blog/?p=552 on a related topic from some time ago.
