A few days ago I mentioned Like.com here.Â  Today’s NYT has an article on Like.Â  On the one hand it is surprising that people (reporters) have such a short memory that they call it first visual search, but on the current topic there are some interesting observations:

The siteâ€™s technology is limited at the moment to searching for items within four categories â€” watches, shoes, handbags and jewelry â€” which happen to be among the fastest-growing retail segments online.
How good a search engine is Like.com? â€œIt works good enough,â€? said Munjal Shah, Like.comâ€™s chief executive. â€œWeâ€™ve found that this is an application where the failings of the technology can turn out to be an asset. People will look at an error and say, â€˜I didnâ€™t know there was another item that was close, but with a different design.â€™ â€?
I hope that visual search becomes successful in this area and then is applied to more general area.Â But be careful in raising your hopes — see my earlier post on this.
Maybe my friends in Multimedia Information Retrieval will be motivated by such successes.

Wow.  This is a serious innovation for the search industry.  I cant tell you how many times I’ve wished I could search for similar things in an image.  I know Like.com isn’t quite there yet, but it’s close.
