    				Knowledge Science 2    			


When I mentioned this term to a few friends, the reaction was usually how come there is no knolwedge science — there is knowledge management, there is knowledge engineering, there is knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation and so on.  What I find interesting is that there are all these things related to knowledge, but there is no ‘science’ trying to pull them togther, trying to understand the complete eco-system around knowledge.  Yet there is epistemology — but that is purely philosophical; like knowledge engineering is purely ‘engineering’ in that it assumes that knowledge is available in a particular form and then ita focus is how to develop systems to use this knowledge.
More I think, more it becomes clear that a serious effort to understand knowledge is really required.  A science of knowledge May help all scientific fields.  Science is all about increasing knowledge using scientific methods in a specific field.  So a scientific approach to understand knoledge will definitely help all  sciences.
