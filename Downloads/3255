    				ZeeTV    			


Neil calls ZeeTV as Zoom-Zoom TV.  This is a good description of the TV station — aptly describel their most programs.
The special effects on most programs are really intense and it seems that their only purpose is to take a 10 minute program and make it 20 minute and add to it another 10 minutes of commercials to make it a 30 minute program.
It would be really very satisfying to see at least some TV shows that are made at current international average — of course better will be better — level.
