Bonnie Nardi Recognized with Lifetime Achievement Award


Informatics Professor Emeritx Bonnie Nardi is headed to Europe, where she will receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Society for Socially Embedded Technology (EUSSET). This society is comprised of researchers interested in socially embedded technologies and how they influence our everyday lives. Recognizing that traditional methods for systems design often do not take into account important aspects of human, social and cultural life, EUSSET members present this award to scholars who have reshaped the computing field with innovative human-centered approaches. Nardi’s work puts her squarely in this group of scholars.

For decades, she has been reshaping the field with her research into activity theory, interaction design, games, social media, and society and technology. This is evident in everything from her 1996 book Context and Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction, to the paper on instant messaging she co-authored in 2000 that recently won a Lasting Impact Award, to “Computing within Limits,” a paper in the Communications of the ACM that explores the relationship between fundamental planetary limits and computing research.
Nardi will attend the 17th European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (ECSCW) in Salzburg, Austria from June 8-12, 2019, where she will be honored with this prestigious award.
