WICS Fall Quarter Week 0: Anteater Involvement Fair 

 10/01/201810/18/2018admin



On September 24th, WICS took part in one of UCI’s biggest event of the year, Anteater Involvement Fair! Countless of new faces ranging from first years to transfer students, and even returning members stopped by to check out the WICS booth. Our representatives were there to share their experience in the organization and to answer any questions regarding the computer science community here at UCI. At the WICS booth, we had sign-up sheets for our mailing list along with more information about our first meeting and mentorship program. If you came by our booth, you might have picked up free swag like the CWIC lanyards before they ran out. For those who weren’t able to check out our booth, you can still be involved by coming out to our weekly general meetings every Monday from 6:30 to 8:30PM at DBH 6011!
