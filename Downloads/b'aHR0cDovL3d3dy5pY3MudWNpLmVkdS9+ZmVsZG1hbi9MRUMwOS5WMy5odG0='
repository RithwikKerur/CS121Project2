A.  Ralph Gerard's Dream for UCI
	•Extensive use of computers including
	•Widespread use of computers in instruction
	•Two images: UC-IBM, the Disneyland campus
B.  What really happened?
	 A brief (biased) historical account of
	computers and education at UCI
	1.  Computer Assisted Instruction --not much 
		•Very modest hardware and software
		•No real plan--hire people and hope
		•Not much money--UC, Carnegie
		•Faculty issues--reward system, hostility
	2.  What did happen?
		•New goal--provide students 
			with computing for coursework
		•Interactive computing
		•Information and Computer Science
		•Changes in computing environment--
			departmental computing, 
			personal computers, 
			scientific computing
		•Persistence of CAI
			John S Brown--Sophie
			Alfred Bork--Physics, Pre-calculus math
			Thomas Standish--Mac based segments
C.  What's happening now in The World and UCI?
	1.  Changes in technology and economics
		•relatively cheap, 
			powerful computing 
			with graphics
		•relatively cheap, 
			powerful communication
			with good access to information
		•lots of students
		•need to keep up with technology
 
	2.  Distance learning
		•industrial versions, e.g., Daimler-Chrysler
		•state and regional consortia
		•business school consortia
		•University of California
		•return to basics
 
	3.  Advantages of Distance Learning
		•Self-paced
		•Best sources
		•No travel
	4.  UCI
		•Bork
		•Department of Education
		•electronic education environment
 
D.  What would a distance learning 
	version of 131 look like?
	1.  What do we have now?
		•text--collection of readings
		•lectures--traditional more or less
		•quizzes
		•discussion
		•project
		•final exam
	2.  What would we have in distance learning version?
		•on-line reading material
		•on-line access to current information,
			e.g., productivity, distance learning
		•lectures--on-line, video, CD
		•e-mail interaction
		•tests
		•projects
