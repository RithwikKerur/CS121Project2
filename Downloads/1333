The Irvine Research Compiler (IRC) compiles a subset of Java source into C. It was designed to support research projects that crosscut both the compiler frontend and the runtime system. It is straightforward to develop new features that require extending both the source language and the runtime system. It contains support for Bamboo, Bristlecone, Software Transactional Memory, Distributed Transactional Memory, standard threaded Java, and Disjointness analysis. It contains a precise copying garbage collector.
The latest version of the Bristlecone compiler is available for download:
To checkout the GIT repository type:
