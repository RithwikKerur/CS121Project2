    				Internet Video on TV    			


NYT has a story on TiVo planning to bring Internet Videos on TV.
Â  Until now, TiVo has not been able to tap into the explosion of Web video â€” clips uploaded by amateurs and, increasingly, professional segments made for the Internet. The new features, which are set to be announced today and introduced early next year, are intended to change that.
This is big.Â  Let’s see how cable companies respond to this — this is extension of DVR.Â  Cable companies copied from DVR from TiVo otherwise they were not ready to put any storage in set top boxes.Â  Here is the next interesting thing for them to look at.
