WICS Winter Quarter Week 4: Battle of the Mentorships 

 02/04/201902/05/2019admin



On January 30th, WICS mentors and mentees got together for some friendly competition and to destress from midterms at Battle of the Mentorships. After munching on yummy pizza, our 50 students were ready to split into teams of 6 and 7 to compete! Mentorship families tested their teamwork and inference skills in games of silent organization and line charades. The evening was full of chaos and laughter as families rushed to deliver their answers. The night ended with each team sharing reenactments of a notable ICS professor. Our mentorship families definitely bonded and reconnected with each other, some are even making plans for later!
