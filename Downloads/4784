        software-defined networking (SDN) and network securit    






I am a NetSys Ph.D. student at University of California, Irvine, where I am part of Distributed Systems Middleware (DSM) groupand Information Systems Group (ISG). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Nalini Venkatasubramanian. My research interest spans across software-defined networking (SDN) and network security. Prior to joining UCI, I received a BS in Information Security from Wuhan University, China. I also have worked in a number of different engineering and programming positions at a variety of organizations.
