    				Pandit does bring recognition to Nagpur    			


I am in Singapore on my way to Nagpur.  Two friends (out of two) here mentioned how a Nagpurian has become the highest ranking Fortune company’s Indian CEO — the highest bank.
Good for Nagpur.  Makes me feel proud.
But this only points to the fact that Nagpur has some distance to cover.  We don’t even have a Citi Bank branch in Nagpur at this time.  Good thing is that like India itself, Nagpur has momentum.
