    				Most popular but little known Photosite    			


Photobucket is the most popular but little known photo site.Â  It is now being acquired for more than $300M.
Everybody talks about Flickr but the traffic on Photobucket is orders of magnitude higher that at Flickr.Â  An interesting example of ‘quietly building’ a solid business.
Photobucket, which has offices in Denver and San Francisco, has catapulted over older sites to become the largest and fastest-growing photo-sharing service on the Web. Unlike rival photo sites such as Kodak Gallery, Shutterfly and Flickr, which is owned by Yahoo, Photobucket positioned itself as a tool for people using sites like MySpace, rather than a place to get prints made or to interact with other photographers.
This is the ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking that resulted in rapid rise of photobucket user base.
