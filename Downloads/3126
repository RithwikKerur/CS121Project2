    				Visiting Rio: First trip to South America    			


Â 

I had never been to South America and Africa.Â  Now at least I am in South America — and that too one of the most beautiful cities in the world — Rio de Janeiro.Â  It is a long trip from Irvine — almost as long in flight time as going to Germany but time difference is onlyÂ 5 hours.Â  Â 
Â 
I am going there to attend — give the first talk — at a workshop called Computer Vision in Developing Countries.Â  I am very curious about it and will report on my impressions after the workshop — including sharing my presentation here.
Â 
I have been warned by several friends about crime in Rio — generally in touristy places in Brazil.Â  I have been warned so much that I am curious about it.
