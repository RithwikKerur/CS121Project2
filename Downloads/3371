    				3D TV — a new version    			


Some researchers in Japan have developed a new version of 3DTV:

â€œThe greatest advantage of our system is to provide interactive control of the viewing parameters,â€ lead author of the study Yuichi Taguchi, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo, told PhysOrg.com. â€œThe interactive control is essential for reproducing a dynamic 3D scene with desirable conditions, which depend on the contents of the scene, the viewer’s preference, and the display specifications.â€

This reminded me of Multiple Perspective Interactive and Immersive videos developed a decade ago but without the autostereoscopic displays.  Very interesting developments, indeed.

Hi Ramesh,
So how long, in your opinion, do you think it will before 3D tv is a reality within people’s homes?
I think this will be a fantastic advance, but i wonder if it will result in more people spending too much time indoors with the consequential problems…

This is still in research phase.  I think it may take several years (if not a decade or more) to get to see this in my home.  I am not going to wait for it yet.
