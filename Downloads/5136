Spring 2021 Week 8: WICS Arcade 

 06/04/2021admin



On Monday, May 17th, WICS Hosted the WICS Arcade Night to offer a space for attendees to destress and spend some fun time together during midterm season and upcoming finals. Overall, there were six separate games with their associated leaders: Drawphone, Bombparty, Just Dance Now, Tetris, Codenames, and Bonfire Hot Seat. Each individual was grouped with five other attendees and put into breakout rooms to play 4 of the 6 games. Each round was held for twenty minutes and facilitated healthy competition, interesting conversations, and engaging teamwork. We hope everyone who came out had a great time and were able to unwind during the stressful last couple weeks of the school year!
