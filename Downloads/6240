Dutt, Kurdahi Awarded NSF Grant for ‘Information Processing Factory’ Computer Chips
April 6, 2018 Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science Nikil Dutt and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  Fadi Kurdahi have received a $900,000 research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that will investigate the development of next-generation “information processing factory” chips that build on recent innovations in manufacturing in which network-connected tools, robots, sensors and computers act in concert to perform complex processes. The project is in tight collaboration with, and complemented by a parallel  German Research Foundation-funded research project at the  Technical University of Braunschweig and  Technical University of Munich.
The advanced chips being designed will come equipped with on-chip sensors to monitor and control performance and health status – keeping track of temperature, energy consumption, wear and tear, and even security threats. Achieving this will require a holistic methodology that encompasses hardware design, software development and new approaches to network architecture. More details on this project can be found here.
