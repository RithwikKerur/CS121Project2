    				Knee    			


It has been now 5 days since I got the Cortisome injection in my knee.  It still feels OK.  Of course I did not have a real chance to test it.  Once I had to attend a party where I needed to stand for long time so I decided to take Aleve for that evening.  Otherwise, it has been a bit slow time to give work to my knee.  Good news is that it has been reasonably quiet in this period.  Whether the relief is due to the injection or otherwise is not clear.
