Winter Quarter 2017 Week 8: WICS Mentorship Baked Goods Potluck and Movie Night 

 03/07/2017Diana Sandil



On Wednesday, March 1st, WICS hosted a movie night for WICS’s mentorship program. WICS mentors and mentees had an amazing time bonding with each other as they baked their favorite recipes. At the movie night, the members were able to interact with other mentorship pairs as they watched “The Emperor’s New Groove”, ate baked goods and pizza together, and engaged in nice conversations. More than 25 WICS members attended the movie night! This movie night was a great and entertaining way for mentorship pairs to meet up and share their favorite recipes. It was great way for WICS members to relax, eat amazing food, and spend quality time with great company!
