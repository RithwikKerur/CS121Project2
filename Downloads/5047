WICS Spring Quarter Week 6: Intuit Tour 

 05/25/201905/25/2019admin



On Thursday, May 9, WICS was invited to visit Intuitâ€™s campus in San Diego. Attendees received a warm welcome from Intuitâ€™s team, which included our former president Katie Yeh! There were brief talks about the Tech Women @ Intuit program and internship/job hunting, followed by a panel with some of Intuitâ€™s top women in tech. Afterwards, everyone was taken on a tour of the campus, which included awesome open floor plans and a huge cafeteria ðŸ˜‰.
