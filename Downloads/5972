Academic Probation Process/Policy
Graduate students are expected to maintain at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA and earn Bs or better.  Failure to meet this standard will result in an academic probation notification email after grades post.  Continual lack of satisfactory performance may result in a recommendation to the Graduate Dean that the student be disqualified from the program and University.
