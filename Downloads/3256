    				Hectic time in Singapore    			


I am in Singapore with Sudha and Neil.  Things have been a bit hectic and hence I was not able to keep up with some of my routine things ‚Äî including reading and posting.  Hopefully now I am back to normal.
Singapore is the gateway to Asia for non-Asians.  And it is a gentle introduction to the West for Asians.  COnsidering the rapid transformations taking place in Asia, Singapore is sitting at a very interesting point.  It is a very vibrant place.  
My sone Neil wants to spend some time understanding this part ofthe world.  He just graduated in Socialogy so this is really a good time in his life to explore this and that too at a really nice place.  I am happy for him.

Well I also want to travel to Singapore. Just manage your time and that hectic schedule will be smoothly done.
Good Luck and take care. üôÇ
