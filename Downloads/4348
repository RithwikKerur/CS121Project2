Shu Kong - Computer Vision














Shu Kong 


I'm a postdoc fellow with Deva Ramanan
in   
 RI 
| CMU.
I got PhD advised by  
Charless Fowlkes,
at CV 
| CS 
| ICS 
| UCI.




My research is motivated by a desire to create intelligent systems that benefit human life, 
primarily through visual signals and interaction between human and machines.
My methodology is "data-driven through learning". 
My focus is on pixel-level learning and prediction for finer-grained visual perception.

Misc



 I love mentoring and educating, probably due to my blood that I am a 76th generation descendant of Confucius, with my family seniority as Ling (令).





བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལེགས, a Tibetan friend gave me a Tibetan name 15 years ago, Tenzing Luobu, 单增罗布. 
But I don't know how to spell -- this fascinates me so much (teach me if you know).





 I was a co-founder of SEED -- a Registered Campus Organization to promote harmony and love within the campus, to bring critical thinking and loving attitude across cultures towards daily lives.





 I'm very slow in responding to messages from all kinds of social media. 
So email should be the best way to reach me.





 I will get involved in cross-discipline research actively, like Big Data Image Processing and Analysis (Big DIPA).





 Joan Agulilar and I designed "almighty search" for Snake game. The "almighty search" can always achieve the highest score, see description here, and technical report here.
