        distributed computing systems, mobile computing, wireless and sensor networks and distributed cyber-physical systems    





Postdoctoral Researcher
I completed my PhD from Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. My research interest includes distributed computing systems, mobile computing, wireless and sensor networks and distributed cyber-physical systems. In my PhD (under Prof. Tarek Abdelzaher), I worked on networking protocols, services and applications for disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs) tailored for disaster response scenarios, with special emphasis on in-network content distillation problems, such as redundancy reduction techniques in crowd-sourced media data gathered from people-centric sensor networks. I obtained my Bachelor and Masters both in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in the year 2004 and 2006 respectively. Earlier, I was a student of Chittagong College and Bangladesh Bank Colony High School, Chittagong. I am a Fulbright Scholar and was a recipient of the International Fulbright Science and Technology Fellowship in 2007.
