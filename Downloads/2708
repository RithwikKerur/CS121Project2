    				Nagpur    			


We have been in Nagpur for the last three days.  These have been busy days among family and friends.  Both Sudha and I grew up here so we have lots of family and friends here.  This is where we met and got married.  We both went to schools and colleges here and went through all the things that young people used to do in this city.  So there are lots of memories here.
Nagpur is growing like most other cities in India.  Lot of new construction going on everywhere.  The city has grown in every direction.  Something unique about Nagpur is its cleanliness and quality of roads compared to other cities in India.  About 4 years ago, the city was cleaned and beautified.  It started looking like a new city.  Unlike most other places that do not maintain their roads and cleanliness well, Nagpur has maintained it.  It is an example that Indian cities don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to be messy and filthy.  Even with its growth, it is maintaining the quality.  That is very impressive.  
Though Nagpur is growing, it is far from a high-tech city.  I am staying in one of the most expensive hotels √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Centre Point √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but there is no Internet facility here.  Suzi had to send some mail and the material was on her USB drive and she could not do it despite visiting two cybercaf√É¬©s.  I am involved in a IT outsourcing company √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Lambent Technology √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú here that is the most prominent high-tech company.  I got involved because I wanted to see such activities in Nagpur.  Shashi and his team has done great job in building this as a local success.  But at the national level, Lambent has a long way to go.
I run into many people here who want to do things in Nagpur and make it a great place.  Yesterday I was contacted by Prasad Dhurjati to discuss formation of an ambitious biotech research university here.  It is truly a small world √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú possible smaller in places like Nagpur.  Prasad was discussing his plans with a group and said he wished Ramesh Jain were in town to bounce-off ideas and somebody who overheard him said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe is and I can track down a telephone number for him√¢‚Ç¨? and he hid.  I was really surprised when contacted because I could not imagine that somebody will get my telephone number (a new one that I got for Sudha) within hours of my getting the number.
It is the biggest city in central India and a big trading center.  Now, a big Airline Hub is likely to come here √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which is starting with a cargo-hub.  This is already resulting in attracting some important national players here.  Some International flights have already started landing here.  So this place may be in for growth.

Dear Dr. Jain,
I have been a reader of your blog for some time now. Your reminiscing about Nagpur brought back fond memories of the place. My grandparents used to live there and we used to go there every summer for a long, fun-filled vacation. 
My parents live there now, and everytime I visit Nagpur, I am struck, just as you were, by how well it has managed to sustain its clean-city looks (my father told me the city has been winning awards for being the cleanest city in India etc.)
I have long wondered why Nagpur doesn‚Äôt seem to interest any of the large Indian players (Infy, Wipro etc.) as a potential dev center.  It has a fairly good airport (well, as good as Pune at least, FWIW) and its central location makes it very accessible by rail. Good climate (IMO, at least), schools, VRCE (I guess it‚Äôs been labeled an NIT now) etc. etc‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs not to like? Quite the mystery to me.
I am looking over http://www.lambenttek.com/ even as I write this üôÇ








Ramesh  Post authorDecember 29, 2005 at 9:19 pm 

Rumors are that Satyam has bought more than 100 acres of land to build their operations in Nagpur.  
Initially most major players focused on a few cities and Nagpur missed on that.  It is likely, however, that in the next wave ‚Äî that seems to be starting ‚Äî it may be a major player.








paresh nautiyal October 24, 2006 at 12:57 am 

Sir
reading your blog fascinated and encouraged me by seeing achivements of fellow nagpurians , though nagpur needs people like you at this crutial stage where it can come of age big time

Dear Sir,
Interesting 2 read yr observation abt Nagpur.
Every city has its own advantages and shortcomings, which goes on changing with the time .Nagpur is also not exception.
As far as future of this city is concerned  advantages are far more than  shortcomings but will need some time i.e. 3 ‚Äì 4 years to slowly realise the potential of this city.
And I am sure as it has changed from 1996 to 2006,similarly
it will be 2 different city by 2016.
rgd,
Sunil

Lambent is not the only big IT co. in Nagpur.

2. Info-spectrum India Pvt. Ltd. is grwoing up fast. It has joint hands with avexus inc. USA for avaiation software development. They are laso shifting in their own state-of-the art building very soon.
3. premier Technology group ( PTG ) also shifting to theri own building in IT park.

yogita June 5, 2007 at 1:47 am 

Hi,
Though not born in Nagpur am staying here  since 6 years. Have seen a lot of progress myself in this span. But the sadest part is no talent of this city wants to stay here and build competitive companies in the city itself. Everybody runs away for the cream.  Who will make the cream of this city tastier and attractive for others to venture??? I myself am not happy with the kind of proffessional opportunities here. When it comes to money no one is ready to pay good for a good talented work. keeping my fingers crossed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.some day‚Ä¶.. always keep the HOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!








Jateen June 6, 2007 at 10:44 am 

I agree with you Yogita.But it will take some time for people to understand the full potential of Nagpur.Further the companies have invested but they are yet to start their operations from Nagpur. So once they start people will definitely come and also it will make companies there more professional about money they offer. But it will take atleast 1.5 to 2 yrs. Once any big name like Wipro, Satyam or HCL start their operations things will change very fast and that will bring more comapnies which are yet sceptical or waiting to start their operations from Nagpur‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..








Ramesh  Post authorJune 6, 2007 at 3:22 pm 

Cultural and social changes always are slow ‚Äî and given our Indian setting they are usually slower.  Things are really on a strong positive trajectory in Nagpur (as in India ‚Äî but lately seem to be faster than on average in India).  It is clear that you are at the right place at the right time and the right thing is to participate in it and be patient.








Victoria June 7, 2007 at 10:14 am 

Well sounds like you are having a great time in Nagpur. Looks like the place is the center for a lot investment activity.








Jateen June 11, 2007 at 11:56 pm

Amol June 26, 2007 at 10:28 am 

Good response, Nagpur is most happning city in central India, big players are coming to nagpur will definately change the face of  city, more and more corporates are investing in nagpur.
Not only names in IT companies given above, one of the company CsTech, Since Year 1998, first company with web solutions (domain hosting web development  web designing) everybody depends upon mumbai delhi based company for this service, this compnay provides same quality services in nagpur. not only few name given above but this company serving 2000 clients across the globe.








Europa July 4, 2007 at 10:18 pm 

I am so glad to read such positive response from Nagpur. I for one have decided to come back to the my home city after a decade. I remember taking in lung fulls of air every time i landed in nagpur. 
Its heartening to note that there are good opportunities coming up and I am hoping for a decent job here. 
Would anyone know some placement agencies? From europaandio@gmail.com








Jateen July 12, 2007 at 11:18 pm 

Cargo Hub Delayed!!!!!!!!!!!
The Vidarbha politicians are doign it again‚Ä¶ CArgo hub has been delayed. A section of farmers are not ready to give their lands at govt. prices.Govt. specially Vidarbha politicians are not keen to solve this issue.MADC has not been handed over the AirPort by AAI. So we are doing it again.This last chance of development will be wasted if people do‚Äônt act fast this project may be moved to Western Maharashtra cities like Pune or Nashik( which i seriously think is the main plot‚Ä¶) Shivsena which is vocal about ‚ÄòEksandh Maharashtra‚Äô which does‚Äônt care  a damn about suicide of Vidarbha farmers has jumped to sabotag this project








Shrinidhi July 21, 2007 at 12:22 am 

With the amount of investment that has already been poured in by both public (MIHAN) & private players in development work being carried out on site, it‚Äôs now unlikely that the process can be reversed. However political will of local politicians having national level stature(like Mr. Praful Patel representing this area) needs to be forcefully sustained all the way.

jateen July 26, 2007 at 8:33 am 

‚ÄòPolitical will‚Äô is very important.It can crerate rivers in deserts.Unfortunately Vidarbha politicians never have any will than earning money by opening Engineering and Medical colleges.Also they were forced to think about Nagpur bcoz it is prominent city in central India alongwith Indore and also bcoz Mumbai and Pune are getting overcrowded.The best thing is that they do‚Äônt looked towards cities like Nashik, Kolhapur and other western Maharashtra cities which always got money and prominence over Nagpur.Further as major cities getting costly being in central india gives wider reach for companies. Also SEZ  here and city with very good infrastructure has attracted many. I always thought that cities like Nagpur, Indore and Bhopal can create a traingle  to attract investment in central india  which is totally untapped region as far as industries are concerned‚Ä¶Hope this investment environment to continues‚Ä¶.

Prashant P September 5, 2007 at 2:53 am 

Well, I am glad to see am not the only one who cares for Nagpur so much. When ever I go on the internet, my wife will pass a comment, not again√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.as the first thing after hooking onto my laptop, I will key in Nagput on Google and read some news about Nagpur and tell her the great guys going Nagpur. 
It makes me feel glad that I belong to city which is organically, while still keeping the values and tradition. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been working on to return back to Nagpur since past 6 years and glad to see myself moving back with family next year to expedite my activity with company that I established in 2003. Way back in 1999 when I left Nagpur, I knew that I cannot stay away longer from this beautiful city and has always dream of making big out of this our Hometown√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ we all fellow Nagpurion can really make it a great place in many ways such as :
1.	Spending money in all good things in the city that we otherwise would have done out of this city
2.	Encourage all innovative business owner and guide them of what best they can do within their current limit based on our own global experiences
3.	Encourage young entrepreneurs with the expert guidance that we have gained out of working around the globe.
And many more such indicative contribution can be made even before we personally get involved to make NAGPUR a happening place to be linked with.








Jateen September 7, 2007 at 6:06 am 

I am at Pune but sad to see that many people that settled here which are originally from Nagpur does‚Äônt think much for the city.There is a perception that Nagpur will never develop which to a great extent is also bcoz  lot of promises were made by our politicians earlier but never fulfilled. Nagpur was ignored, humiliated by moving the money of its share to other cities, never got status of ‚ÄòSecond Capital‚Äô in reality its only on paper but no one bothered. Ngpur will develop if our collective urge is strong to develop it.So many people like me left Nagpur bcoz there were no higher end jobs.We ourselve are guity not tos et up or start industries there.Hope Cargo and SEZ will change that as investment continue to pour in.People now beginned to understand the benefits of beign at ‚Äòcentre‚Äô of India‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.








Ajay Rathore October 4, 2007 at 2:43 am 

Yes‚Ä¶.you are right Jateen. Politician here are wants to eat butter on dead body. They are not hungry about the progress but wants to earn popularity for no work only. Take example of Medical University, previously it was supposed to be in Nagpur, but now it is in Nashik. There was supposed to be a railway coach factory in orange city, but its not there. Generations are changing but the status of political progress is not. Everything is in hands of political leader. MPs, MLAs of city are not struggling to the desired level. Anybody comes and slaps it. (e.g. Train services like Maharashtra express and now Vidarbha express are stolen away from city‚Ä¶. lots of examples ). You note down one thing that Cargo and Mihan are not going to operation in atleast next 20 years. Thats the reason real Nagpurian are not interested in fake promises shown by local politicians.








Jateen December 15, 2007 at 1:12 am 

Well Ajay you are right!!! [b] Cargo Hub is unlikely to complete or succeed[/b] There are strong political forces which are blockign Nagpur Cargo Hub.[b]Nagpur airport has‚Äônt been handed over to MADC[/b].Now we heard that 40k investment will be coming up on Mumbai Pune Highway. I bet with anyone this project will complete much faster that Nagpur Cargo Hub. As far as Nagpur Cargo Hub is concerned, i fear that within some months time it will be shifted out Nagpur as there is not enougth pressure for this project. God Save My City!!!!!!!!








Dr. Vivek Polshettiwar February 8, 2008 at 3:53 pm 

There is no good research center in Vidharba and opening of DRDO center will be great achivement. I worked with DRDO for 3 years and I know thier labs are richest in terms of facilty and projects, and the students of vidharbha will definately get benefited. Infact, if there is any DRDO opening in Nagpur, no. of scientist like me in USA will return to India.
We all Vidharbhians should fight for the betterment of our region, otherwise we will losse everything, what we deserve.

Vandana March 12, 2008 at 2:53 pm 

I read this blog as I am looking for software opprotunities in Nagpur.
I was in dilemma of returning back to the city I love. I am interested in the big IT companies planning to start their centres in Nagpur in 2008. I can not go to other cities as I have 2 kids and I want to start their education in Nagpur.
From this blog as well as the from the video on Youtube about Mihan Project, I have no doubts that Nagpur is the city I want to return to.

Ramesh,
Your post truly highlights one of the most fascinating elements of the internet marketplace today: Accessibility.  I thought this post was particularly interesting because of the fact that one person could gain international exposure‚Äìespecially in India.
Throughout my career, some of the most progressive entrepreurs I have met have come from India.  
Godspeed to all the leadership that you provide on this blog‚Äìyou truly connect us and give hope to those who aspire to build relationships, worldwide, with like-minded individuals.
