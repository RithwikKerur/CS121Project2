    				Computers in Libraries in Developing countries    			


Gates foundation is trying to bring advantages of Internet to developing countries:
Â The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has announced the expansion of its Global Libraries Initiative, a project that will invest $328 million over seven years to help developing countries plan and install free computer and Internet service in public libraries and reading rooms. According to the foundation, 87 percent of people worldwide have no Internet access. The Global Libraries Initiative aims to alleviate the problem of computer and Internet availability in 12 to 15 developing countries.
I think this is much better idea than the $150 computer.
