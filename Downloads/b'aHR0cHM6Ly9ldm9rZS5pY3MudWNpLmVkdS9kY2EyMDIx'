Datafication & Community Activism 2020


 Datafication & Community Activism 

2021
2019

2021
Building on what we started back in 2019 at the first D & CA workshop, this year’s forum brought together scholars, journalists, graduate students, artists, adjunct lecturers, para-academics, public scholars, community organizers, and data/information professionals interested in thinking through the relationship between activism and research. We wanted to highlight, support, and advance activist responses to datafication, especially in the context of the lived experiences of racialized and minoritized communities.
