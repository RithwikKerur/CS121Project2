    				Camera with 3D effects    			


John Markoff reports in NYT about a camera that will help bring sophisticated 3D effects.  As pointed out:

The system could change the nature of cinematography in several ways, according to leading Hollywood producers and technologists who are planning to use the system. For example, it will make it possible to create compellingly realistic synthetic actors by capturing the facial movements of real actors in much greater detail than is currently possible.
A step towards immersive presence (or telepresence) that has been a dream of many people and has been a darling of science fiction writers.
