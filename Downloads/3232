    				Pain management after knee surgery    			


I had my knee surgery yesterday.  It is amazing how easy this surgery has become.  I had my left knee replaced in 2001 and it was relatively lot more painful than it has been this time.  Pain management techniques have definitely improved significantly.  Less than 24 hours after the surgery I was waling as my physical therapy and it was easy.  Also, all the bandages and casts seems to be lighter and much easier to manage.
Knee surgery has definitely become a routine surgery that — of course when needed — is easy to go through.  Now I am thinking why did I  suffer so long — I should have gone through it long time ago.  The real issue is to find 4-6 weeks time without travel.
Today was my second day in Rm 420 of Long Beach Memorial hospital.  Dr Warden thinks that I may go home on Sunday.
