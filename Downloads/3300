    				Historic Day:  Today’s Election    			


Today is a historic day — not only for USA but for the world.  No other election has been so consuming and apivotal point in the history.  I am eagerly waiting for Obama to be elected as the 44th president and start a new cultural revolution in the world just by getting elected.  Michael Kinsley says it very well in his Op-Ed piece in NYT:
Thanks for this healthy development go to John McCain, for choosing Sarah Palin, and to Barack Obama, for choosing himself. Also for being himself â€” a one-man ethnic stew. If America looks like anyone, it looks like him. Sarah Palin deserves, if not credit, then a bit of sympathy. She wants America to keep looking like a small town in western Pennsylvania around 1966. She was the last, victorious shot in a revolution she doesnâ€™t support. 
I do hope that not only Barack Obama wins, but wins by a great margin to make the message even stronger.

You make a great point in this blog. I just voted about an hour ago, and I am a first time voter so this was obviously an important time. Everyone should get out and vote. I too hope Obama wins.
