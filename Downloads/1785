I work on the Answers & Web Ranking team. We are an NLP-oriented R&D team. Our goal is to provide fast and direct answers to the questions people ask their devices.
If you are interested in training and deploying ML models for a user-facing product, we are hiring!
Prior to Apple, I was a Senior Data Scientist at Turi (a startup formerly known as Dato and GraphLab). I helped build the NLP and recommender system toolkits for Turi Create.
During graduate school, I focused on probabilistic models for relational events, e.g., communication or interaction within a social network. I obtained a Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics at University of California, Irvine, working with Padhraic Smyth and the DataLab. I also had the opportunity to do research internships at Google Research NY (with Daryl Pregibon) and Microsoft Research (with Chris Meek).
