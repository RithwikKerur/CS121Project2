WICS Meeting 


WICS First General Meeting 

 10/11/201209/06/2013admin



Before our trip to Grace Hopper, WICS hosted its first general meeting.  We had a great turnout of about 40 people, with a much higher representation of women than previous years!  Following our presentation of this quarter’s events, we pulled out the card games, and for the next hour and a half our new members met each other, ate pizza, and played card games.
We briefly asked people about how they felt about WICS this year, and many were relieved to have a friendly and low-pressure group in ICS that they can relate to.  Many were able to dispel their fears that they would be isolated in ICS this year!  As a result our organization will be hosting more social events for women in ICS to mingle and approach each other in a much easier environment than in the classroom.
We’re looking forward to a busy and productive year!
