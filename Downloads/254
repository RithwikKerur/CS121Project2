Provide Projects


We strive for all of our undergraduate students to engage in real-world projects as part of their studies. Our majors, therefore, contain courses that are driven by projects provided by outside sponsors – corporations, government organizations, educational institutions, or nonprofits. Guided by the instructor and leveraging best practices that we teach throughout our programs, these projects tend to focus on the design and implementation of applications, but also may involve technology assessments or other work related to understanding and advancing how people live, work and build in a digital world.
Projects frequently tie in to modern technological trends, developing new web applications and portals, online services, cloud computing and tablet and mobile applications. At the same time, quite a few of our sponsors wish to explore new ideas or business opportunities concerning their proprietary products, which is equally encouraged.
Project courses run for either one quarter or two quarters. We welcome proposals for the following courses:

User Interface Design and Evaluation (graduate course for our informatics Ph.D. and M.S. students)
Project in Software System Design (undergraduate course for a variety of our majors)
Senior Design Project (undergraduate capstone course for our informatics and software engineering majors)
Capstone Game Project (undergraduate capstone course for our computer game science majors)

Contact our associate director of corporate relations to get involved or learn more.
Watch our video to learn more about the Informatics Capstone Project Student Showcase.
