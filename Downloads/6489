                I am a Distinguished Professor in the
		Computer
                Science Department of the University of California,
                Irvine, director of the Center for
                Algorithms and Theory of Computation, and associate
                director of
                the Center for
                Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization.

		
My research (see selected publications) has covered many topics in
                computational geometry and graph algorithms, including:

Graph drawing and information visualization
Dynamic graph algorithms and dynamic closest pair
		  data structures
Mesh generation and optimal triangulation
K-shortest paths and related combinatorial
		  enumeration algorithms
Subgraph isomorphism and network statistics
Data depth and robust statistics
Exponential-time algorithms for NP-hard problems

I am also an avid photographer and have many
                photos in my web photo
                gallery.
This site is quite static; if you want more frequent

My name is not uncommon (although the spelling
                is atypical); see my page of Eppsteins on the net if you
                think you've reached the wrong me.
