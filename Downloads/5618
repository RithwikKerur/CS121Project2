SDCL Software Design and Collaboration Laboratory






Research

Our research is driven by the desire to improve the day-to-day life of software developers and focuses on understanding and advancing the roles of design, collaboration, and education in software development.
We primarily employ a tool-driven methodology, exploring a broad range of research questions by designing and building novel software tools. Through empirical and field studies that inform tool design, our work both anchors itself in real-world practices and demonstrates the tools’ impact on those practices.
Education is a key interest of the SDCL. We employ many of our tools in the classroom, and even have developed a number of approaches specifically for furthering the education of future software engineers.
