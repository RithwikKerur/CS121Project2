    				Video Communication is starting    			


An article by Anne Eisenberg in NYT has interesting information on this trend that has to happen.  Here is how the article starts — and then gives interesting details:
STILL keeping in touch with friends by texting? How old-fashioned. Some early adopters of technology are now using their mobile phones to send not typed words or photographs, but live video broadcasts. Theyâ€™re streaming scenes from their daily lives â€” like trips to the mall, weddings, a new puppyâ€™s antics or even a breaking news story that they happen upon.

Technology is a wonderful thing. I am a photographer and am always searching for new ways to integrate movement in my images. I just starting to implement sequence shots into a video like format. I take about 10-20 photographs of a bride and groom dancing or doing something fun and place them together into a video broadcast. This would be cool to send via telephone to friends and family.

Yes Video communication has grown to a large extent. Even video call is available in some countries.

I still find this incredible that this technology exists and is now a part of mainstream society. When I was a child I used to watch science fiction movies and programs in awe, where a person would communicate with another through ‘picture phone,’ which was usually some sort of a big block on the users desk.
Now we carry this sort of technology around with us. Quite astonishing we have come so far in such a  short time.
