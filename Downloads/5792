Platypus: “A Ludicrous Relationship? A Conversation between Anthropology and Game Studies” (Co-authored by Informatics Ph.D. Students)

July 20, 2018


Informatics Ph.D. students Spencer Ruelos and Amanda Cullen had their article titled “A Ludicrous Relationship? A Conversation between Anthropology and Game Studies” published on Platypus, the official blog of the Committee on the Anthropology of Science, Technology, and Computing. The blog post discusses the need for those who work in both game studies and anthropology to build deeper connections between the two disciplines in order to help scholars overcome finding themselves lacking a sense of academic belonging in either field.

Inside Higher Ed: “Melting Away Myths” (Kurt Squire quoted)

July 19, 2018


Kurt Squire, a former UW Madison professor who now teaches at the University of California, Irvine, thinks that the political and economic climate of the state has allowed the town-gown divide to grow. “There’s been a really strong effort by right-wing think tanks to create a division between universities and the public,” Squire said. “The animosity is really clear — there are members of the state Legislature that have it out for the university and they don’t really hide it.”

SportTechie: “Esports Curriculum Meets High School Children Where They Play” (Constance Steinkuehler quoted)

July 17, 2018


“You see the same effects for esports leagues that you do in sports programs in general,” said Constance Steinkuehler, a professor at UCI and one of the main developers of the curriculum. “We’ve seen a decrease in absenteeism, an increase in feeling associated with school, and an increase in positive relationships with teachers.”
Steinkuehler is one of the leading researchers in this space. Before coming to UCI she served as a Senior Policy Analyst in the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House Executive Office. Now she  studies how schools can connect esports and academics.

U.S. News & World Report: “Schools Use Esports as a Learning Platform” by Constance Steinkuehler

June 13, 2018


Constance Steinkuehler, professor of informatics, writes: “Through the spring season, our research team at University of California—Irvine has carefully observed students, parents and coaches, and we’ve made some exciting discoveries. Already we have seen some students shift from a focus on their own individual glory to their team’s best interest, and from a reactionary stance toward their performance (“We lost and it stinks!”) to a proactive stance (“OK, that didn’t work. What can we do differently next time?”).”

The Atlantic: “The Most Honest Out-of-Office Message” (Gloria Mark cited)

June 12, 2018


Research has shown that returning to email after a brief hiatus can be stressful. In a 2012 study, Gloria Mark, a professor at the University of California at Irvine who studies how information-technology use affects people, prohibited some office workers from using email at all for one workweek, and let others maintain their usual use. She strapped heart-rate monitors on all of them. Mark found that the participants who were cut off from email experienced significant reductions in their stress levels, as indicated by changes in their resting heart rates. When people return to their regular routine, so does the stress, she says.

Verge: “Game developer pranks player after he threatens to shoot up studio” (Katherine Lo quoted)

June 7, 2018


Katherine Lo, an online harassment researcher at the University of California Irvine, says it’s important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to threats and harassment — and that in many cases, this may not be the right one. “I worry that the message being projected here is that this is the ideal way to handle threats, or that no threat should be interpreted as genuine. In many cases that’s not a viable option,” says Lo.
