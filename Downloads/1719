Back to Puzzle

Segmentation
Input: Photo of puzzle piecesOutput: List of (x,y) pairs for each puzzle piece

Level set methods
Yutian's ncut-derived method
NJ's ideas from media class
Contour extraction / representation
Input: List of (x,y) pairs for each puzzle pieceOutput: Some nicer representation?  Perhaps a bunch of "piece objects"?

Relative angles
Discretised directions --> BLAST
"Continuous" directions --> Correlation?
Eamon's shape representation
Alter slightly to accommodate comparisons
Local polynomials, curvature
Raman's n-gram approach
Comparison / local matching
Techniques depend on representation
Can include color, texture, etc.
Global solution / energy minimization
Jon's approach for canonical puzzles
Belief propagation / affinity propagation
More ideas?  Simple BFS?
Final reconstruction / assembly
Stitch the pieces together so they look nice
