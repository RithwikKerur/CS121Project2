WICS Fall Quarter Week 1: ICSSC x WICS Meet and Greet with Ingram Micro 

 10/30/2020admin



On Thursday, October 8th, 2020, of Week 1, Ingram Micro hosted a Meet ‘n Greet and info session. They went over their recruitment opportunities and showcased their product management team. They explained their hiring pipeline, including tips on internships, full-time roles, and their rotational program! One of the speakers, Jerry Chang, their Sr. Product Manager for Global eCommerce, Storefronts, walked us through how he went from studying biology and statistics to switching to product management! He gave tips for future product managers, that anyone can switch anytime, and that folks should focus on learning business, design, and technology with ‘least/no cost as possible’. At the end for those who stayed, they raffled Starbucks gift cards too!
