WSJ: “Foreign Students Seen Cheating More Than Domestic Ones” (Hancock quoted)
June 5, 2016 Statistics Professor Stacey Hancock was recently interviewed by The Wall Street Journal for a June 5, 2016 article titled “Foreign Students Seen Cheating More Than Domestic Ones.” The in-depth article looks at the rise of alleged cheating by international students at public universities in the United States. Hancock was among several professors who were interviewed from around the country for the article. According to Hancock, a large portion of faculty time is spent trying to ensure academic honesty and deter cheating by putting safeguards in place such as randomized seating and offering multiple versions of a test.
