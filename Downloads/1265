Department Seminars 2018-2019


Every Friday from 2-4 p.m. during the academic year, the department organizes a Friday seminar, for which it typically brings in outside speakers. All seminars are open to anyone who wants to attend, and is followed by a social hour with drinks and snacks. The seminars are an excellent opportunity to be inspired by what others are doing, learn about the state of the art and interact with influential researchers from across the world.
