Anna Alexander Lambrix


Software Engineering
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your studies?
I entered UCI as a computer science major but later switched to software engineering. I am a transfer, which means I took some classes in Santa Monica City College before and only transferred to UCI last fall (2013). I always say that it is UCI who chose me, I actually lived in Westwood with my family and did not want to move and spend money on housing in OC as it can get very pricey, so I was hoping to go to UCLA, but when UCI sent me an invitation to join them, I gladly accepted it, as it is a good school with a great research reputation. You probably don’t get this kind of response pretty often but for me, the UCI is situated “in the middle of nowhere,” which I especially liked — more incentive to concentrate on my studies.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
I would say it is the projects and homework we have to do. I really like the programming labs because it lets me interact with students of my major or similar to it who are a course or two “older” and they are a wealth of information, both pertaining to the current assignment, and also regarding professors, future courses I have to take, and the university overall.
Have you done an internship?
Nope, but I have been working part time for two years at a web development company. I basically build (code) web sites, predominantly on the WordPress platform, sometimes I get to exercise my programming skills to the full by altering plugins and getting to really code certain solutions (so far only in PHP for the most part) to fit the clients’ needs.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
I read to primary school kids in Koreatown of Los Angeles. I guess you can call it my social activities. I used to live in K-Town, and the area is dear to me. I know that majority of kids going to schools in that area are children of recent immigrants, and their life is not easy. Reading to Kids organization wants to make sure these kids have a good future, which is partly dependent on good education and the motivation they get to read, to study, to push forward.
What are you most proud of so far?
I dislike the expression “being proud of.” Pride is a negative emotion for me. Let me put it this way: I am darn glad I haven’t given up yet. I am an older student, and going back to school has not always been a joyful ride. I’ve been through very dark times. Perseverance is what I thank most of all for where I am now.
What has been the best part of your experience?
I think the relative ease with which I have adapted at the university. UCI is the kind of place where they try to help you adapt. I was petrified at first — going to a place with a lot of very young people, and a lot of them have been here since their freshman year. And here I am, straight from the comfort of Santa Monica into a big educational establishment like UCI, scared like crazy, afraid that I will be completely lost. It turned out to be a relatively easy transition. A lot of people here are ready to help you, a lot of people here do care for your success. I was thrilled.
What are your aspirations?
I want to build software, and I want to create something of my own at that. I am very much into languages — well, being a bilingual person basically, as well as having had to learn a few more due to my non stop travels and multilingual friendships, I want to work in educational field, building software for people to learn, to progress, to better themselves and the relations with each other. My other affinity is education for children. I would be thrilled to work in that field, creating programs for the kids through which they can learn while playing.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
I would tell them to not fear. Especially to the ones in my situation — students after 25, independent, with no family back up, completely on their own, studying and working at the same time, trying to make the ends meet. It only seems insurmountable, but if you don’t give up, and don’t doubt yourself, you can make anything happen. The most precious thing you must make sure not to lose is your curiosity. Curiosity and desire to find an answer to certain questions is what pushes the scholar further, what makes them forget about everyday problems and strive for success.
