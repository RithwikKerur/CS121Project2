					I am Associate Professor of Informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.
						
					My research interests lie at the intersection of humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI), computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), and health informatics.
						
					I received my Bachelor of Medicine degree (MBBS) from the China Medical University, and PhD from the iSchool at Drexel University.
					Currently, I serve as Director of the Undergraduate Minor Program in Health Informatics, Vice Chair of Undergraduate Affairs at Department of Informatics, and Co-Director for the Health and Information Lab.

					Inspired by my own experience and training, I am interested in the interplay bewteen information, people, organization, and technology in healthcare. 
					I study how different stakeholders in healthcare access, document, share, and make sense of complex health data and information in their personal, professional, and social contexts. I am particularly interested in how these activities are mediated, communicated, coordinated and supported through technlogical tools from the sociotechnical perspective.
