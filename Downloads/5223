Fall 2020 Week 10: WICSmas 

 12/07/202004/23/2021admin



On Monday, December 7th, 2020 of Week 10, WICS hosted a festive-themed event where attendees could hang out, socialize, and destress for the upcoming finals week. All attendees were able to choose to participate in two short rounds of assorted creative activities within their associated groups which were led by WICS committee members. They were given the chance to channel their inner artists with group painting, origami, color sheets, or build a group jigsaw puzzle. We hope everyone had a fun and relaxing time and was able to make new friends within their groups!
