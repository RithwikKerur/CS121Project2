EXPRESSION




















 



EXPRESSION 
is an Architecture Description Language (ADL) as well as a retargetable 
compiler/simulator tool-kit for architectural design space exploration (DSE). A 
processor-memory architecture can be captured using the Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
The front-end of the tool-kit generates the EXPRESSION description for the 
processor, which in turn steers automatic generation of retargetable compiler 
and simulator.

The key features of our design methodology 
include: 



  Ease of specification and modification of 
  architecture from the GUI.


  Mixed behavioral/structural representation 
  supporting a natural, concise specification of the architecture.



  Explicit specification of the memory subsystem 
  allowing novel memory organizations and hierarchies.


  Efficient specification of architectural 
  resource constraints allowing extraction of detailed Reservation Tables (RTs) 
  for compiler scheduling.


The complete EXPRESSION 
toolkit is now available as an Open Source Release in the public domain. The 
goal of this Open Source release is to promote usage of 
    EXPRESSION ADL to specify processor-memory architectures and provide a 
reference point for further research into ADLs
