    				More timelines    			


I saw one more advertisement of a timeline maker – you can see it at
http://www.timelinemaker.com/education.php
I am hearing more and more about events.  Starting from Twitter, to Facebook updates, to timeline makers, everybody realizes that events are important.  And something needs to be done using events.  I definitely feel that we are going to see and hear more and more about events and computational appraoches to deal with the complete eco-system dealing with events.  Ultimeately, to model the world, one must use both events and objects.  In computer science we have done well to deal with objects, but we really don;t know how to deal with events.
