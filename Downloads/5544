Global Game Jam 2020: A Model of Diversity and Inclusivity

February 18, 2020


For six years now, UCI has participated in the Global Game Jam (GGJ) — the world’s largest hackathon for game development. During the last weekend in January, GGJ 2020 included more than 48,700 jammers at 934 jam sites around the world, including 160 participants at the UC Irvine site, led by Informatics Professor Theresa Tanenbaum.

North Carolina Public Radio WUNC: “Embodied: How Online Gaming Creates Real-Life Love” (Tess Tanenbaum mentioned)

February 13, 2020


Customizing the features of an avatar can be an intensely personal experience. It can offer fantastical escapism, an expression of a hidden self or a pixelated reflection. Tess Tanenbaum discusses how designing digital counterparts can help break players free of oppressive social norms — and why the majority choose to remain shackled. She is an assistant professor in the department of informatics at the University of California, Irvine.

Connected Learning Alliance: “Reflections on a Decade of Engaged Scholarship–The Final Report from the Connected Learning Research Network” by Mimi Ito

February 6, 2020


It’s rare to have the opportunity to work with a stable team of extraordinary scholars over the course of a decade. It’s even rarer for this group of scholars to span a wide range of disciplines and approaches, while sharing common concerns in research, educational practice, and social change. A long time in the making, we are at last releasing our final collaborative report, The Connected Learning Research Network: Reflections on a Decade of Engaged Scholarship, from the MacArthur Foundation Connected Learning Research Network, that grew out of a decade of the network’s work together.
