Dutt, Levorato awarded NSF grant for healthcare IoT research
August 24, 2017 Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science Nikil Dutt and Assistant Professor of Computer Science Marco Levorato have received a $300,000 research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for designing a personalized ubiquitous healthcare framework using the Internet of Things (IoT). Dutt and Levorato are leading the research project “IoCT-CARE: Internet of Cognitive Things for Personalized Healthcare” jointly with Finnish partners at the University of Turku, the Turku University Central Hospital and VTT Finland. The two-year project investigates a self-aware cognitive IoT architecture for ubiquitous health monitoring that can predict the early onset of critical health conditions such as heart attacks. The project is funded as part of the NSF WiFiUS program, which is jointly managed by the Academy of Finland and the U.S. National Science Foundation, and aims to expand research collaboration between Finland and the United States in new areas of wireless telecommunications research.
