    				Open Cable Platform    			


At CES, Brian Roberts announced Open-cable Platform. This is

the beginning of an “open” cable services platform called Tru2way, which enables cable service to be integrated directly into a variety of consumer electronics devices.

 This truly has potential to impact home netertainment in a big way.
Interesting thing, on the side, is that the cable industry is usually a closed industy.  This trend of getting toward open platform may be a revolutionary trend in US entertainment world.
