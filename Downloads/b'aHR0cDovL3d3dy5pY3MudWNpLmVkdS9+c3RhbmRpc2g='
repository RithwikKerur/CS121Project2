List of Eleven Ph.D.s and Eight Masters

       Author of five books on data structures and algorithms.
Published widely 
             in other venues in pursuit of other interests. (For more,
see pubs.pdf.)
       
       One Publication
of Possible Interest
             I
discovered an unusually efficient O(n) method for
address-calculation
             sorting, called ProxmapSort, and a
companion O(1) searching technique,
             called ProxmapSearch, that uses a proxmap
to search for keys in an array 
             that has already been sorted by ProxmapSort.
If the keys are uniformly and 
             randomly distributed, ProxmapSort
sorts an array of n keys using only 
             1.5 n
– 0.5 unit operations. ProxmapSearch
requires an average of only 
             C
= 1.5 – (1/2n) key comparisons for a successful search, and C′ ≅ 1.5 – 1/e
             key comparisons for an unsuccessful search. 
                     My
co-author, Norman Jacobson, had considerable success using
             proxmap searching and sorting to
motivate his CS2 students to become 
             interested in the theory of algorithms and data structures,
and Norm pressed
             me to write a paper with him for publication in Inroads
– The SIGCSE Bulletin.
             (SIGCSE
is the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education.)
                     A
table of running times comparing ProxmapSort with
other well-known 
             sorting methods is given as follows, where the running times
are in milliticks 
             (60,000ths
of a second) averaged over 100 trials:

                     The
paper was published in two parts and is available for download from the
             ACM
Digital Library, but, unfortunately, the proxmap
diagrams in Parts I & II were
             misprinted due to an unintended font change. (Interested
readers can view original
             pdf preprints of Part I  here and Part II here.)
