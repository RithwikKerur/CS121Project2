    				Computer Vision    			


 Computer Vision
I spent several years addressing different problems in the challenging field of computer vision. I still find this area one of the most exciting and rewarding. Research in computer vision requires borrowing ideas from many fields and using some clever engineering to solve real problems.
Here I am listing some of my papers that are unique in some aspects. The paper 1 is the first paper in dynamic vision. The paper 2 presented results that are now commonly used in many practical systems. Paper 3 though in computer vision, started going towards databases. Paper 4 and 5 resulted in creating significant interest in dynamic vision. Paper 6 is the paper that became a very popular paper on range images. Another earlier paper by Besl and Jain influenced many computer vision researchers to look into range images. Paper 7 was a detailed foundation on edges in scale space. Paper 8 showed the limitations of the structure from motion approaches popular at that time. Paper 9 gave rise to interest in textures that result in many flow related applications.

which one is the best language for computer vision implementation

These items are quite relevant to my nephew’s area of study. I shall send him a link.

Hi Mr.Ramesh ,
 I see that you are talking about Computer vision.
 I find one amazing free to download book about Computer Vision. Hope you will be interested because it is really amazing,trust me. :).
This book features representative work on the computer vision, and it puts more focus on robotics vision and omnidirectional vision.
This is the link where you can find it: http://sciyo.com/books/show/title/computer_vision
