The Wrap: “Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg’s Artificial Intelligence Divide: Experts Weigh In” (Singh quoted)
July 26, 2017 “Overall [Musk is] definitely too negative,” said Sameer Singh, Associate Professor of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine, during an interview with TheWrap. “I’m much more positive about it and so are a lot of AI researchers — otherwise we wouldn’t be working in this area if we thought it was going to spell doom for the society.”
Professor Singh focuses his research on machine learning, and believes the human-AI dynamic will continue to be a master-and-servant relationship for years to come.
