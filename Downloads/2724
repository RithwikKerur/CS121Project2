    				GYM and Cable+TV+Telco    			


Interesting reading about Google-Yahoo-Microsoft on one side and TV, Cable and telcos on the other.
Is this ride really going to continue?  How long?  Or is it really end of the old way of (Push) distribution and the beginning of the new way (Pull) distribution as well as new models for rewarding the content producers?
Somehow I like to believe that the later is true — the new world is here.
