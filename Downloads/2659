    				Esther Dyson and When2.0    			


Yesterday I had a very exciting discussion with Esther Dyson about the role of time and events in computing and in emerging applications.  Time has been implicit in many computing applications.  Now time has come to make time explicit and allow ‘temporal computations’ in our routine application programs.  Somehow this is not yet appreciated by community.  I was delighted to see a resonance in these ideas with Esther.  
She invited me to talk at When2.0 in December and I was only pleased to accept that.  Now I have to start thinking what to say to make the point clearly.  Of course, it is expected that by that time we may have a version of Seraja product/services that I can show to people.
