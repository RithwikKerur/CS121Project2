Special Opportunities


ICS theme house
Students in any of our majors are eligible to apply to live in the ICS Theme House for a year. The ICS Theme House is in the on-campus Arroyo Vista housing complex and provides informal academic and social functions. The goal is to expose residents and visitors to faculty, alumni, and businesspersons in the information and computer sciences field.
Activities include:

Visits to corporations;
Community and career building opportunities;
Symposia promoting academic success and learning skills;
Workshops preparing for graduate and professional schools; and
Social activities.

Honors opportunities
UC Irvine offers a vibrant campuswide honors program (CHP), to which any student can apply as long as they meet the criteria for admission into the program. CHP offers select events; peer mentorship; a campus “hang out” where you and your fellow honors students convene, work, and socialize; honors housing; and special research opportunities.
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences also offers its own honors program, which focuses on research. Juniors and seniors who are accepted into the program first learn about the research process in an honors seminar, engage in (minimally) two quarters of advanced research work with a faculty member, and write a research paper for review by their faculty advisor and the Honors Program Faculty Director.
Students in our majors are traditionally strongly represented in both CHP and the ICS honors program, and many Informatics faculty members like advising honors students on their research projects.
Scholarships
Both the campus and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences offer scholarships on an annual basis. Please visit the following two links for more information:

Jobs
Our students are in high demand. Many of them obtain part-time jobs early in their academic careers, enabling them to put into practice what they learn and bring back to their classes real-world problems and experiences. Some, too, secure their future employment well before graduating.
UC Irvine maintains a portal, Handshake, that lists internships and job opportunities.
More information
Prospective and current UCI students interested in learning more about these opportunities are encouraged to contact our vice chair for undergraduate affairs or call our Student Affairs Office at 949-824-5156 to make an appointment.
