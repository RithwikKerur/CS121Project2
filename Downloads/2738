    				Academic Reviewing — Simone Santini    			


Simone Santini has a very interesting collection of  ‘history’ of reviewing that should be read by all research students so they know that reviewing is not the end of their ideas — it could be the beginning of a new field.  I tried to find the example that I like the best — but all of them are really unique.
Great job, Simone!
