$5 Million in NSF Funding Boosts Development of Mixed Reality (XR) Platform for Workforce Training

December 17, 2020


What does the future of job training look like for manufacturing? With current innovations in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), it should look nothing like today’s inefficient and expensive processes based on paper pamphlets and in-person training from experts.
“The existing standard is the worst educational experience that I’ve ever seen,” says Kylie Peppler, a professor of informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). Peppler is part of a multi-organizational team, led by Professor Karthik Ramani of Purdue University, that aims to greatly improve manufacturing workforce education with Skill-XR, a new training platform that leverages AR, VR and mixed reality (XR) applications.

Expanding Technology Access to Support People with Visual Disabilities During the Pandemic

December 15, 2020


UCI researchers collaborate with Toyota to provide Aira, a visual interpreter service, to local community members.
The pandemic has brought about a host of challenges, with social distancing presenting difficulties for everyone — especially for those with a visual disability. How do you know your proximity to people if you can’t see them? How do you get assistance from others while remaining six feet apart? These are questions Informatics Professor Stacy Branham decided to address together with Toyota Motor North America (TMNA).

ICS Researchers Win Best Paper Award for Detecting COVID-19 Misinformation

December 4, 2020


Sameer Singh
Earlier this year, as the global pandemic started shutting down much of the world, medical researchers quickly moved to better understand the virus and work on a vaccine. Researchers from UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) took a different approach. As Assistant Professor of Computer Science Sameer Singh explains, “work started as an outlet for the students to positively contribute to the fight against COVID-19 the one way we know how — by throwing machine learning at it!”
