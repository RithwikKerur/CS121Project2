    				Ancient Rome born in 3D    			


Using computer graphics and simulation technology, a very realistic model of ancient Rome has been prpared.Â  This model described in National Geographic and other places shows how modern technology could be used to studyÂ history.
There is an increasing trend to model not only old cities but current cities also.Â  What is interesting is that some of this is being created by user generated conetent.

Thanks for the scoop!
Seeing how old information is made available in a new form is always great. This is a good example of what digitalization allows us to do, and how we can really expand the depth and scope of information with it.

It would be wonderful if there would be computer-generated model graphics of the old kingdom of Thailand and Cambodia. I am living in Thailand now.
