WICS Winter Quarter Week 7: Women in Games Panel 

 02/20/201903/06/2019admin



On February 19th, WICS and VGDC invited Amanda Cullen, a PhD Student at CATS Lab, Candace Thomas, a Senior Encounter Designer at Blizzard, Nikki Crenshaw, an associate UX researcher at Blizzard, to host a panel at UCI of women involved in the video game industry. We went through questions about how they discovered their interest in computer science and video gaming, acquiring a job or graduate program, and their struggles in the industry. Afterwards, the attending students were all able to ask questions as well! We were able to learn a lot about the video game industry as it stands and even tips on how to both interact with coworkers and pursue career advancements in the future.
