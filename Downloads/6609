Michael Shindler
I am an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Computer Science Department at UC Irvine.


Office: DBH 4058

If you want to meet with me, for example if you are thinking of graduate school and want to discuss it, and would otherwise drop by my office hours, but aren't in my class this term, please send me an email and I will try to find time to meet with you.

 

To form my email address:



For course-related topics, concatenate mikes with [at] ics [dot] uci [dot] edu


		For all other topics, concatenate mikes with [at] uci [dot] edu

My research focuses primarily on educational issues in computer science;  I am particularly interested in issues related to teaching Computer Science Theory courses, such as identifying and correcting student misconceptions in these courses and also discovering concept inventories.  I am also interested in more general issues involving the scaling of class sizes and making efficient use of resources for student learning.  


In the past, my computer science research touched on computations on large datasets, machine learning, approximation algorithms, streaming algorithms, and data mining.

Teaching

For every class I teach, all students are responsible for all material and due dates in the class, even those that occur prior to their enrollment.  If you are planning to add the class after day one, please contact me at the start of the quarter, preferably at the conclusion of the first lecture.  You should plan to attend every lecture starting at day one, even if you are not yet enrolled.   

This quarter, Fall 2022, I am teaching the following courses:

I&C SCI 46 : Data Structure Implementation and Analysis
CompSci 260P : Algorithms 



For the 2022-23 school year, I am tentatively set to teach the following courses.  These courses will be offered on-campus.  There is not currently a fully virtual option for any of these courses, nor are there plans to create one.


Winter 2023: I&C SCI 46, CompSci 161
Spring 2023: CompSci 162, CompSci 260P



In both Fall and Winter quarter, when I am teaching I&C SCI 46, the current plan is for there to be two lectures.  Students are welcome to attend either one, regardless of enrollment, with the following two exceptions:


On exam days, you are required to take the exam in your enrolled section.
If we run out of seats on non-exam days, priority for seating is for students enrolled in the section.

Erdos Number
My Erdos number is 3:

I co-authored  Streaming k-means on Well-Clusterable Data (SODA 2011) with Rafail Ostrovsky (and also with Vladimir Braverman, Adam Meyerson, Alan Roytman, and Brian Tagiku)
Rafail Ostrovsky co-authored The linear-array conjecture in communication complexity is false (STOC 1996) with Nathan Linial (and also with Eyal Kushilevitz)
Nathan Linial co-authored Extremal problems on permutations under cyclic equivalence (Discrete Math, 1987) with Paul Erdos (and also with Shlomo Moran)


I would like to thank the American Mathematical Society's collaboration distance calculator for providing me with an easy way to determine this.
