Distinguished Professor Alex Nicolau Elected into Academia Europaea
October 9, 2018 Department Chair and Distinguished Professor of Computer Science Alex Nicolau has been elected into the Academia Europaea, Europe’s academy of humanities, letters and sciences. Founded in 1988, the academy comprises esteemed scientists and scholars who collectively aim to promote learning, education and research. Nominated by their peers, members are selected after a rigorous review process that is based on sustained academic excellence in their field. AE members include 73 Nobel Laureates and six Turing winners.

Joining Gene Tsudik, who became an AE member in 2015, Nicolau is one of only 17 members from the U.S. in a computing-related field. His research interests include parallelizing compilers and high-performance, power-aware and reconfigurable computing.
“Unlike other academies that represent individual countries,” notes Nicolau, “the Academia Europaea is a continent-wide academy, so I feel honored to be recognized at this broad, international level.”
