Site /
Site Administration


Here you find some links to Site configuration pages. Add links to other pages you may need for your site's configuration here, as necessary. Some links may only apply to certain configurations or skins.

Note to new administrators: All pages in the 'Site' group (except Site.SideBar) are locked for editing as the default. Site.SideBar is locked with the site-wide edit password, if one is set.  In order to edit any other page in this group you need to create in local/config.php a sitewide admin password (see PmWiki.PasswordsAdmin). Then you can edit pages and change the access protection of individual pages  by changing the page attributes with ?action=attr.
