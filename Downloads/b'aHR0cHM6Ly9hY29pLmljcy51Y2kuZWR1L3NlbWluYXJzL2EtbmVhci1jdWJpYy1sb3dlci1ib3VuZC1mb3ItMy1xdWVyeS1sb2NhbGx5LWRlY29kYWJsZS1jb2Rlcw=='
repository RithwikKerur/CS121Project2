A Near-cubic Lower Bound for 3-query Locally Decodable Codes

Abstract: Locally decodable codes (LDCs) allow for ultra-efficient recovery of
any single message symbol by querying a very few codeword symbols. In
addition to their appeal for storage and cryptographic applications,
locality is a fundamental concept in coding theory with many
ramifications across computational complexity. An outstanding
challenge concerning LDCs is their optimal encoding length for a
desired number q of queries. For q=2, it is known that exponential
blow-up in encoding length is necessary (and the simple Hadamard code
achieves this). For q > 2, however, there are significant gaps in our
understanding. For instance, for 3-query LDCs, the best constructions
require sub-exponential encoding length, and the best known lower
bound, that has stood for two decades, was only quadratic.
In this talk, we will describe a near-cubic lower bound on the
encoding length of 3-query LDCs. The approach is inspired by and
borrows from recent advances in refuting semi-random instances of
constraint satisfaction problems.
Based on joint work with Omar Alrabiah, Pravesh Kothari, and Peter Manohar.
