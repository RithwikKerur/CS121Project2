The Guardian: “Video games can turn university graduates into better employees” (Constance Steinkuehler and Kurt Squire cited)

January 18, 2019


Scholars including James Paul Gee, Constance Steinkuehler and Kurt Squire have suggested that much of the pleasure we gain from playing video games is derived from the joy of learning. Such advocates of game-based learning argue that games are complex systems which players must work hard to understand. They must communicate with one another if they are to coordinate their strategies in multiplayer games, exercise critical thinking to solve puzzles, and adapt to the ever-changing circumstances that games present.

January 16, 2019


University of California-Irvine is the No. 1 team in the inaugural Top 25 College League of Legends Coaches Poll.
The Top 25, which was released Wednesday, is the first poll of its kind in college esports. ESPN gathered responses from a group of more than 40 college coaches in the U.S. and Canada to craft the rankings, which will be updated every other week. League of Legends developer Riot Games assisted in identifying seasoned coaches in the College League of Legends scene and provided data to help inform the preseason rankings for those coaches.

BBC: “Why an off-the-grid hour at work is so crucial” (Gloria Mark quoted)

January 15, 2019


“If a person has a habit of smoking, and they’re away from their cigarettes for a while, it creates tension,” says Gloria Mark, who led that 2012 study about email and who’s an informatics professor at the University of California, Irvine. Depending on your job, eliminating (or even significantly reducing) tech may also be totally unrealistic. But Mark thinks organizations also have a responsibility to ensure employees don’t become tech slaves.

Hispanic Engineer: “UC Irvine hopes to find how young people are using digital technology” (Mimi Ito quoted)

January 9, 2019


One in three users of the internet is younger than 18, yet cyberspace isn’t geared toward them. That’s why the Connected Learning Lab in the California Institute for Telecommunications & Information Technology at UC Irvine hopes to better understand how young people are using digital technology. … Cultural anthropologist and informatics professor-in-residence Mimi Ito directs the lab. … According to Candice Odgers, a UC Irvine professor of psychological science who studies adolescents’ mental health and development, many adolescents are actually thriving in the digital age.

Mobile Banking Prototype Exemplifies Value of Capstone Classes for Students and Businesses

December 19, 2018


The Informatics Senior Design Project infuses undergraduate education with hands-on, practical learning through external partnerships from local corporations and organizations. During spring and summer 2018, the banking solutions company Global Wave Group offered its support and sponsored a project. By the end of the two-quarter capstone course, the four informatics students who teamed up to work on the project — Daniel Lee, Lilyann Khung Torres , Griffin Williams and Aivan Eugene Francisco — had not only gained real-world experience, but had also developed a mobile banking app prototype and successfully presented a demo to Global Wave Group’s client, First Foundation Bank.

Entrepreneur: “Why Entrepreneurs Are Constantly Distracted (And 6 Ways To Fight Back)” (Gloria Mark quoted)

December 18, 2018


If you’re like most entrepreneurs, you find yourself struggling with distractions on a regular basis. Whether it’s an email notification, a meeting or a new emergency to deal with, every distraction can potentially pull you away from whatever project you’re working on. And that’s not good because, according to Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, “Once thrown off track, it can take some 23 minutes for a worker to return to the original task.” So, why are entrepreneurs so susceptible to distraction and what steps can they – and you – take to fight back against this vulnerability?

The Conversation: “With a limited on-screen presence, autistic characters have emerged in another medium: fan fiction” by Rebecca Black and Jonathan Alexander

December 13, 2018


As scholars of fan fiction and young adult literature, we started noticing how some fan fiction authors were incorporating autism into their stories – sometimes through new characters and other times by rewriting existing ones. Since then we’ve been collecting and analyzing fan fictions in which young writers have created characters with autism.
