    				Sharing your Visualizaion    			


After sites that allow you to share, pictures (Flickr), videos (YouTube), thoughts (blogs), now there is a site that will allow you to share not just your data but your visualizations.
As reported in NYT,
At an experimental Web site, Many Eyes, (www.many-eyes.com), users can upload the data they want to visualize, then try sophisticated tools to generate interactive displays. These might range from maps of relationships in the New Testament to a display of the comparative frequency of words used in speeches by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. 
This will help many people who want to play with different visualization tools.  This will definitely make it easy.
