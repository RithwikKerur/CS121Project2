    				A German Wedding    			


Two of my very good friends got married to each other — Susanne Boll and Utz Westermann decided to finaaaaaaalllllllllllllyyyyyyy get married on May 19th.Â  I had the pleasure of attending this wedding with Sudha and Smriti (Suzi).Â Â  In fact, we decided to make this trip to Germany more a nostaltgic trip to visit Hamburg after 30 years — yes Sudha and I lived their 30 years ago.
The wedding was near Memmingen (which is near Munich).Â  The location made it more special.Â  In a German village setting everything was set to be kind of a story-book.Â  The church where the wedding took place, the musuem where the reception was, and all the arrangements were unique in their setting and creating a very romantic experience.Â  The best way to describe this experience is to share the experience with you and I can only do that using some tools that Utz has helped create in the form of Seraja.
