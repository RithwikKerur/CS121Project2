    				The Next YouTube    			


Is it possible to select next mega star company?Â  Well Business 2.0 has given a list of 25 such companies that you can see HERE on CNN site.
It is interesting to see how people project current trends to find next mega star, and usually the mega star emerges from an area that is not even in ‘ball park’.Â  I am sure the next mega star company is going to emerge from some fundamental technology, rather than one more flavor of social networks.
