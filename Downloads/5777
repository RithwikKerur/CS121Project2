Developing a Data Analytics Course for Low-Income High Schools

November 20, 2019


A new class offering at select high schools in San Jose, Philadelphia and Cleveland is exposing low-income students to data analytics, preparing them to leverage future career opportunities stemming from advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The new curriculum was made possible with a grant from Deloitte Foundation, which supports education through a variety of initiatives that help develop the talent of the future and promote excellence in teaching, research and curriculum innovation, and Base 11, a nonprofit focused on engaging students from low-resource communities with STEM education, and was developed in consultation with UC Irvine. The award was made to UCI to develop a high school data analytics course targeting the needs of low-income students and involved a partnership between UCI’s Office of Access and Inclusion (OAI) for the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) and the Samueli School of Engineering.

Ph.D. Candidate Reyhaneh Jabbarvand Selected as “Rising Star”

November 15, 2019


Informatics Ph.D. candidate Reyhaneh Jabbarvand recently attended the 2019 Rising Stars in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Workshop at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Since the workshop was first launched at MIT in 2012, women graduate students and postdocs interested in pursuing academic careers in computer science, computer engineering and electrical engineering have been invited to attend the intensive workshop, held at various institutions annually. This year, Jabbarvand was one of 90 women invited to the event, making her part of the largest class of participants to date.

Fast Company: “People are building technology that could survive the apocalypse” (Bill Tomlinson quoted)

November 8, 2019



If computing resources become more scarce and networks fracture, even deciding what information to store could become an important question, potentially leading to scenarios such as communities dividing up pieces of resources like Wikipedia to try to preserve it across computers, says Bill Tomlinson, a professor and vice chair of the Department of Informatics at the University of California at Irvine.

Healthline: “People Are Getting Their STDs Diagnosed on Reddit” (Sean Young quoted)

November 7, 2019


There’s also a lot of information missing from the Reddit posts that could help health officials understand what’s going on. “Like many social media studies, this study didn’t provide info on the location of the people posting about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) on Reddit, whether they were being honest or if it was a hoax, how their actual STI risk compares to those not using Reddit, etc.,” said Sean Young, PhD, executive director of the UC Institute for Prediction Technology and a professor in the departments of informatics and emergency medicine at UC Irvine.

Student Spotlight: Veteran Chauncy Sapien Hopes to Create Software to Support the U.S. Military

November 4, 2019



Chauncy Sapien is a software engineering major in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). He is gaining experience during his senior year by working part time as a software engineer at Raytheon. However, before Chauncy took the job at Raytheon, he was a peer advisor and webmaster for UCI’s Veteran Services Center (VSC), which provides veterans with the “world-class benefits and services they have earned.” Chauncy himself earned those benefits while serving in the United States Marine Corps (USMC). He is one of 23 veterans in the School of ICS and 167 veterans (including both active duty and reservists) at UCI, and he is president of the Anteater Veteran Association (AVA). Here, the devoted veteran, student, software engineer and father to five-year-old son, Ryan, talks about his service in the Marines and future career plans.

Family Circle: “Mind Control: How to Focus and Pay Attention” (Gloria Mark quoted)




I wonder whether I have to give up multitasking too; it seems crucial, in light of what I need to get done in a mere 24 hours. Plus, I consider myself a maven at accomplishing a million things all at once. As it turns out, I’m kidding myself. According to a study conducted by Gloria Mark, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, every time we switch from one project to another and back again, we lose a hefty amount of mental efficiency, as well as create a certain level of stress. “If we are interrupted from a task, it takes us a full 23 minutes to circle back to our original degree of concentration for the job at hand,” says Mark.

Informatics Alumna Lilly Irani Receives Diana Forsythe Prize for Chasing Innovation

November 1, 2019



The 2019 Diana Forsythe Prize has been awarded to informatics alumna Lilly Irani (Ph.D. ’13) for her book, Chasing Innovation: Making Entrepreneurial Citizens in Modern India. The prize celebrates work in the spirit of Diana Forsythe’s feminist anthropological research on work, science or technology, and the book captures that spirit in its examination of how long-standing power hierarchies continue to influence opportunities. In particular, the book documents the rise of “entrepreneurial citizenship” in India, demonstrating how “a global ethos of development through design has come to shape state policy, economic investment, and the middle class in one of the world’s fastest-growing nations.”

NPR: “It’s A Smartphone Life: More Than Half Of U.S. Children Now Have One” (Mimi Ito cited)

October 31, 2019


Teens report spending only 3 percent of their screen time on creative pursuits like writing, or making art, or music — outside of homework or school projects. But some researchers, like Emily Weinstein at Harvard, and Mimi Ito at the University of California, Irvine, note that social media platforms like TikTok, Snapchat or Instagram can be platforms for creative expression in ways that aren’t necessarily captured by a survey like this.

Boston Globe: “Amid BC suicide case, a look at how texting can empower abusers” (Gloria Mark quoted)

October 30, 2019


The effect of a text extends beyond the five or 10 seconds it takes to read it, added Gloria Mark, professor of informatics at the University of California Irvine, who studies the impact of digital media on people’s lives. Emotions and anxiety surround anticipating the text, and then reacting to it. Exchanging a torrent of texts every day has got to interfere with a person’s life, she said: “It’s a way of controlling.”

EdSurge: “How to Connect With Your Kids’ Digital Interests and Become a Media Mentor” by Mimi Ito

October 29, 2019


Helping children maintain a healthy media diet goes beyond simply curbing their device usage. In 2016, the American Association of Pediatrics backed down from their two-hour-a-day screen time guidelines. They now propose a more tailored approach, suggesting that parents can be “media mentors” and not just time cops.
