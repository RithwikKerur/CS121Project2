    				Tags give human meaning    			


Daniel Terdiman has a nice report on ‘Tagging’ on News.com.  This report gives a good summary of how tagging has stron social roots and is becoming a popular mechanism to share information — like images or documents or to find appropriate blogs.  Good reading.
