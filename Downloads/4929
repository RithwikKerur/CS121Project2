Week 5: Women in Technology Talk by Northrop Grumman 

 11/03/201312/01/2013admin



Cecilia Rubio came to talk to WICS about her journey into the world of IT as a woman on Wednesday, October 30th. Over 20 people came to learn about what it is like to work in Northrop Grumman, a leading global security company, and how Cecilia always presented herself as prepared and motivational, leading her to multiple job and internship opportunities. Being confident and overachieving is key to staying employed and possibly promoted in a company. Benefits that a company offer and its work environment is very important when looking for jobs, being happy in your future job is always the number one priority! Northrop Grumman offers many benefits for employees and is now hiring!
Don’t worry if you missed out, there are more opportunities in the future, stay updated with WICS’s events!
WICS would also like to thank all the people that came to this event even though they had midterms!
