    				Contenxt Search    			


Search has used content for quite some time — in pure text, databases, and multimedia.  Lately application of context has started receiving increasing attention.
The real progress could be made if we really combine content and context.  Approaches should be developed that are really both content and context based.  I think we should start using ‘contenxt’ to describe use of both content and context in search.

I was going to comment on the misspelling of contenxt but then I read your article and now it makes sense. Maybe a new word for the websters dictionary 🙂
