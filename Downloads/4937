Workshop 


Aspire IT Camp: Techie Girls 

 08/03/201310/12/2013admin



In Techie Girls,  a week-long summer camp was designed for the 2013 Aspire IT Programs to inspire in girls a love for computer science. The camp provided workshops from July 29th through August 2nd on the UC Irvine Campus for 2 hours a day.

More than 10 of WICS’s members volunteered to help teach more than 20 middle school-aged girls technology. The camp provided a sampling of web design, programming, graphics, and game design using HTML, Python, and Kodu Game Lab. WICS members helped any kids who had trouble learning these programming languages.
At the end of the camp, there was an open house where certificates, free food, and free swag from companies were given to all the participants.
