Hadar Ziv Resume 1997




Hadar Ziv


Objective

Seeking full-time tenure-track opportunity
as faculty member in software engineering, specifically development
of complex software including object-oriented systems, data mining,
and intelligent agents.

Summary of qualifications

I have been a software developer since 1983, a teacher
and instructor since 1986, a researcher since 1988, and a consultant
and mentor since 1993.  My professional expertise is in development
of complex software systems, including object-oriented (OO) analysis
and design methods (Booch, Rumbaugh), OO programming languages
(C++, Ada), and the corresponding development tools (Visual C++,
Rational Rose, Select OMT, Ada compilers).  I am also proficient
with Microsoft technologies including Windows 95/NT, MFC 4.x,
and COM/OLE programming.  My research experience includes all
aspects of the software development lifecycle, as well as software
process modeling, software understanding, software visualization,
hypertext and hypermedia.

My teaching experience includes close to 1,000 computer
professionals in Southern California trained in OO Analysis and
Design methods and Microsoft Windows programming using Visual
C++ and MFC.  Currently I am consulting and mentoring in object-oriented
software development to Beckman Instruments, a Fortune 500 company
in Fullerton CA, and to ObjectAutomation, a promising start-up
in Irvine CA.

Upcoming Books


"Intelligent Software Agents: A Compendium of
Theory and Practice," to be published by Addison-Wesley in early
1998.

"The Coherent Object-Oriented Lifecycle: From
Analysis and Design to Successful Implementations using Visual
C++ and MFC,"  to be  published by Addison-Wesley in late
1997.
