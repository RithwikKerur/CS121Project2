    				Seraja Software    			


Due to various reasons, Seraja was not successful in its current incarnation.  Rajesh and I are determined to support the basic philosophy of eventbased organization of information and experiences and of EventWeb.
I will use the current software to do research in my group at UC Irvine — some enthusiastic students (Arjun Satish, Mingyan Gao, Pinaki Sinha, Setareh Rafatirad, and Bo Gong) are already playing with it for Media Management application.  We will make it usable by academic groups and make it available to other research groups for experiments.  Some groups are already eager to use the software.
Sometimes due to lack of focus a particular copany is not successful.  I feel that was the case in the last Seraja also.  We could not focus on where should this be used initially to refine it and make it usable before going to other applications.  Anything that tries to address multiple applications from the beginning, ends up addressing no application.  And that happened with Seraja.  A good lesson.  But too late for Seraja.  And a funny thing is that we knew it but we could not control other factors to overcome the problem.  Well, so is the life of an entrepreneur.  
No time to dwell on past, time to think of doing eventweb applications right in specific application contexts.  And that’s what I want to explore and have already started doing it.  It has become more exciting project to do.

Yes, there’s nothing much we can do about requirements and specifications. Hopefully, we can at least make sure that few things like software requirement specifications (SRS) should work properly, so that there’s no buoyancy in work flow.
We don’t have any idea why that particular software was not successful enough to make its mark but I would like to convey some good implementation techniques to the newbies as far as software development is concerned. Top quality requirements specifications begins with a complete definition of customer requirements. It should also incorporate a natural language that shows strength and weakness quality indicators.

Well there are a number of things that could have gone wrong with this software. Although I think lack of focus is a general ‘out’ that you can use I think there was a lot more to it than that.
