Spring 2022 Week 6: Midterm Mixer 

 05/12/202205/15/2022admin



On Monday, May 2, 2022, WICS held a Midterm Mixer where members were able to study for midterms and plan their Fall 2022 class schedules together. Additionally, there was a spreadsheet where people could ask for or provide advice and insight on different classes. Overall, it was a very academically productive night for WICS!
