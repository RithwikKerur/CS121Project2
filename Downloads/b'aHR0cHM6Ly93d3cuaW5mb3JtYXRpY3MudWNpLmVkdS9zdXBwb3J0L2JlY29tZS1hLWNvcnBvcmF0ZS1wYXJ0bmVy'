Become a Corporate Partner


The Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences Corporate Partners Program provides concierge-level service to assist companies in growing their relationships with our students, faculty and staff in order to reach their strategic goals. Members of the program gain a single point of contact for identifying and recruiting interns/full-time hires, increasing brand visibility, and connecting to key resources within the school and university.
The Department of Informatics is strongly represented in this program and always welcomes new partners to work with.
Corporate partners join at one of three levels:

Corporate Partner ($10,000/year): Talent acquisition.
Premier Partner ($25,000/year): Talent acquisition and corporate presence.
Visionary Partner ($40,000/year): Talent acquisition, corporate presence and strategic partnering.

Contact our associate director of corporate relations to get involved or learn more.

A recent event held at Thales, one of our corporate partners, allowed ICS students, alumni and faculty to connect with the company’s leadership.
