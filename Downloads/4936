WICS Week 0: Meet and Greet 

 09/26/201310/01/2014admin



Wednesday, September 25, 70 students interested in Computer Science came out to participate in the first annual WICS social event. Students, new and old alike, socialized with the WICS board members as well as each other, played board games, and won cool prizes while enjoying FREE food and drinks!
People had a chance to make some new friends, and freshmen had the opportunity to converse with upperclassmen for advice in the Computer Science field. Tammy Phan, an ICS alumni who is currently working on campus, came to talk to WICS about a tech conference in January about web application security. She gave WICS members information about open internship positions in the department she is working in and welcomed anyone to apply. WICS will be hosting plenty more similar social events throughout the year including other activities such as technical workshops and many other cool events.
Stay updated with our events to gain support and experience with your fellow classmates! WICS will be holding its annual Mentorship Mixer on the Monday of Week 1. WICS board members and an overview of future events will be introduced. RSVP on our Facebook page now and don’t forget to sign up for our Mixer!
