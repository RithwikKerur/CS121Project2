The Arcadia Research Project

 Welcome to the home page for the Arcadia Research Project.


Arcadia is a research project investigating tools and techniques to
improve the software engineering process.  The goal of the project
is to support the creation of software engineering environments
intended for the development, analysis, and maintenance of large, complex
software systems, particularly those with high reliability requirements.
Additionally, Arcadia is committed to a highly distributed, tool-based 
architecture that supports flexible environment evolution, heterogeneous 
tools (i.e., developed using a variety of programming languages, object 
management systems, etc.), and organizationally dispersed software
engineering.



This page contains links to the various people, institutions,
projects, and publications encompassed by the Arcadia research
consortium.
