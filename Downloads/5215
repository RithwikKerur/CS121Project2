WICS Fall Quarter Week 6: ACM x WICS Mock Technical Interview 

 11/18/201811/18/2018admin



On Monday, November 5th, WICS teamed up with ACM to host mock technical interviews! Upperclassmen with extensive interview experience volunteered to share their expertise with those who signed up. Attendees were given a coding question that could come up during a typical technical interview. They were encouraged to think out loud as they code on a paper, the interviewer giving hints and advice along the way. This event was a great way for ICS students to practice before any real upcoming interviews. Thank you to our attendees, we hope this event was insightful! Good luck hunting for internships or full-time jobs, and we hope to see you at our next event!
