    				Protecting Ancient Indian Knowledge    			


Stephan Franklin sent me an interesting podcast link.Â 
India Works to Shield Traditional Knowledge from Modern Copyrights
A new digital library in India is safeguarding ancient knowledge from patents, which can force royalty payments for knowledge that is common in that part of the world. NewsHour correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro reports from New Delhi
Considering that many such patents have been tried in the west, this is a great strategy.Â  I wishe there could be more projects like this in India to protect and publicize the ancient and community knowledge that exists there.
