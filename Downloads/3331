    				Sharing your photos: Fotonaut    			


Fotonaut.com is trying to become a combination of Flickr and a Wikimedia for photos.  Interesting model and ambitious approach.  It is still in private beta.
It appears that this service will allow you to link information available on the Web to your photos — thus if you visit Great Wall in China, you will be able to link information about the Great Wall from all sources to your photos so people can also know the history.  Or, you could link your blog or some other comments from different sources to the photo.  Thus, this site is trying to become much more than just a photo sharing site.
I will get back to you with more after I play with this site some.
