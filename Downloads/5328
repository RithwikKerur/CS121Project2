Bytes of Code Summer 2018 

 08/10/201811/18/2018admin



August 1, 2018 – August 8, 2018
This summer, WICS helped out with Bytes of Code, a week-long program created to teach middle school and high school girls the basics of computer science. This camp is intended to encourage young girls to consider pursuing a career in Computer Science.
On the first day, the students were introduced to coding using Spheros, where they could use block-coding to program a robot and tell it where to go. This fun activity was also a good visual representation of how you can use code to tell a computer what to do. The girls’ next project was to create apps using Thunkable. The girls really enjoyed this activity since they could design the way their app looks, and some of them even went on to create another app on their own time! Finally, the girls were challenged to use HTML & CSS to create their own website. They were excited to see their webpages showing up on their own URLs, and they took time style their website and make it their own. The girls received certificates and got to demo their websites to their parents.
On the last day of Bytes of Code, we visited Google Irvine. Engineers from Google gave us a cool tour of the office. They also gave us great advice for women interested in pursing a career in technology. The girls got to ask questions to the engineers and learn more about Google and working in the STEM field.
Bytes of Code was a great way for the girls to become familiar with computer science. A special thanks to Erica Hsueh and Ashley Hsieh for organizing the curriculum, and to NCWIT for making this possible!
