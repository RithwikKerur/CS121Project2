    				Other India    			


It is very heartening to read an article in TOI about the stars that are rising from villages in India.   The key point is well summarized in:
Their address is obscure but their calling card is Talent. Meet the rising stars of New India: Small-towners who are taking centrestage, not just in cricket but also in IITs and IIMs. 
Hope that this continues.
