Week 8: Thanksgiving Potluck »









This will be the last project meeting of the quarter! Each team will submit their finalized websites on Wednesday, Nov. 27th! Details will be provided as the day approaches, a prize will be awarded to every participating member! The team with the “best” website (judging criteria can be found in the PowerPoints)  and the team with the most points awarded from weekly challenges will be announced on Wednesday, Dec. 4th and each receive a special mystery prize!
WICS looks forward to seeing how everyone has progressed with HTML and CSS and hopes the learning will continue on. Light snacks will be provided, be sure to come to this meeting for any personal help from WICS! Future questions will be answered on the Facebook group.
Stay tuned for next quarter when WICS will start a NEW project!
