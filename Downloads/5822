NMSU Roundup: “Video game labor yields economic value” (Nardi quoted)

April 24, 2015


A visiting professor of anthropology to New Mexico State University gave a presentation on April 17 about the economic benefits that video game developers get from the free labor of their players.
Bonnie Nardi is an anthropologist in the School of Information and Computer Science at University of California – Irvine. Nardi started studying “World of Warcraft” almost 10 years ago when some of the undergraduates she was teaching started talking about such games as “WoW” and “EverQuest.”

Professor Olson Recognized by Google Co-founder

April 21, 2015


Informatics Professor Judith Olson has won many accolades and been widely published over the years, but it’s not often that you are recognized by the likes of Google Co-founder and CEO Larry Page. In a book recently released titled The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, Page acknowledges the impact Olson had on him as a student: “The college course that made the greatest impression on me was one on human-computer interaction taught by Judith Olson. The goal was to understand how to design interfaces that were easy and intuitive.”

BBC: “A generation of cyberslackers” (Mark quoted)

April 9, 2015


Some experts question whether millennials are truly committed to changing their ways.
When Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, in the US, told her students to track their use of technology for a couple of weeks, most were startled to see how much time they spent on the Internet. They reported that they’d like to improve their attention spans, but ironically, they wanted to use technology to help them limit their technology use.
“They aren’t willing to change intrinsically, but instead want an extrinsic means to do it,” such as an app that temporarily blocks access to email or social media sites, Mark said.

Ito presents on ‘connected learning’ at SXSWedu Conference

March 30, 2015


South by Southwest’s education conference (SXSWedu) held in Austin, Texas, invited research scientist Mimi Ito to present at its newly formed closing program in March. Ito discussed “connected learning,” the concept of harnessing information and social connectivity for education. She presented alongside GRAMMY Museum Executive Director Bob Santelli, actress and founder of Hawn Foundation Goldie Hawn, and Khan Academy founder and Executive Director Sal Khan. 
The single-stage closing program highlighted unique educational convergences by exploring education through the lens of music, film and interactive technologies. “The closing session is a new format, and intended to bridge the education and interactive programs,” Ito says. “I think it is an important signal that we need to find ways to unite the social agenda of educational reform to innovative technology approaches.”
Ito’s discussion of connected learning advocated for using today’s tools to advance the longstanding goals of progressive education. “Too often, new educational technologies are used to reinforce traditional forms of education which we know are not effective or empowering to the learner. We have the opportunity to change that,” she says.





ICS Ph.D. Grad Receives Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from iSchools

March 23, 2015


Information Schools (iSchools) has awarded recent ICS Ph.D. graduate Xinru Page a Best Doctoral Dissertation Award for her dissertation “Factors that Influence Adoption and Use of Location-Sharing Social Media,” which seeks to understand real-world factors shaping behaviors and attitudes toward location-sharing social networks (LSSN), especially as to why people avoid or abandon this technology, or limit their usage. Page, now an assistant professor in computer information systems at Bentley University, was advised by Informatics Professor Alfred Kobsa. Her current research interests include privacy, technology adoption, interpersonal communication, social media and human computer interaction. During her time with ICS, she received a Dean’s Fellowship and Yahoo! Best Dissertation Fellowship Award. She will receive her latest $2,500 prize at this week’s iConference, iSchools’ international gathering of scholars and researchers concerned with critical information issues in contemporary society. The iSchools selection committee, drawn from leading international schools, noted that Page’s dissertation is timely and important, with one reviewer calling it “a multi-method tour de force which masterfully integrates qualitative and quantitative research.”
