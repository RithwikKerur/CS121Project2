WICS Winter Quarter Week 10: WICS Potluck 

 03/14/201904/03/2019admin



On Wednesday, March 20, 2019, WICS hosted their end-of-the-quarter potluck. Friends brought lots of delicious food to share such as dumplings, fried rice, rotisserie chicken, pasta, brownies, and cookies. Yum! We sat around in tables and bonded with our fellow ICS students. We worried about our upcoming finals and chit-chatted about our plans for spring break. After eating, we had fun playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Giant Jenga! This event was a great way to bond and destress with WICS members during the typically stressful Week 10. We hope everyone had fun during the potluck! Good luck with your finals, and see you in Spring Quarter!
