    				Being too early is worse than being late    			


In entrepreneurship, being too early is worse than being too late.Â  I have seen this happen too many times.Â  One case that I personally experienced with some good friends (Bradley Horowitz, Jeff Bach, Chiao-Fe Shu, Paul Lego, …) is the case of visual search for shopping.Â  What Riya announced now and seems to be getting some traction was announced and championed by Virage in 1995.Â  But that was too early and Virage became standard image blade (or cartridge) on popular databases, but could not build business so moved on to video.
Â My best wishes to Munjal Shah for making this happen now.

Just back from Oxford Valley Mall – things do seem to be picking up. Are others feeling the same?
