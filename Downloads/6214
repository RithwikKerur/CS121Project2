Los Angeles Times: “A machine taught itself to solve Rubik’s Cube without human help, UC Irvine researchers say”
June 25, 2018 Two algorithms developed by the researchers, collectively called Deep Cube, typically can solve the 3-D combination puzzle within 30 moves, which is less than or equal to systems that use human knowledge, according to the team’s research paper. Less than 5.8% of the world’s population can solve the Rubik’s Cube, according to the Rubik’s website.
