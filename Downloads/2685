    				COntrols at Wikipedia    			


Current flurry of articles related to problems at Wikipedia  are unfortunate but hardly surprising.  Society always faces this problem — due to some undesirable elements, the whole society has to bear the burden of policing and other controls.  And our activities in cyberspace are no exceptions.
There is a bigger issue that is going to become more important due to such events.  The issue of trust is aq serious one.  How much could you trust what you see on the Web.  This issue has been talked about but no serious solutions — or even efforts — have been put forward.  This issue is a fundamental one for the Web to get into the next phase of its existence and continued success.
