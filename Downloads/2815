    				SenseWeb    			


Rajesh (from emergic.org)  pointed out an interesting article that is related to the one that I mentioned in my last post.  This article describes a project by Dr. Nath of Microsoft to assimilate all sensory information and present it live:
By tracking real-life conditions, which are supplied directly by people or automated sensor equipment, and correlating that data with a searchable map, people could have a better idea of the activities going on in their local areas, says Nath, and make more informed decisions about, for instance, what driving route to take.
It is clear that Web is now evolving from its early stage of being the DocumentWeb and is trying to become more real world centric.
