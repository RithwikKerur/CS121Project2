About

								I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Irvine, advised by Prof. Charless Fowlkes. Prior to joining UC Irvine, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Alan Yuille at Johns Hopkins University. I have also spent a wonderful time working with Prof. Rene Vidal and Prof. Joshua Tenenbaum for a short period.
							






Research Interests

 My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, especially deep learning. 
 My current research focuses include 1) 3D scene understanding, 2) domain adaptation, 3) generative models
