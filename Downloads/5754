Alumni Spotlight: Rohit Khare’s Distinguished Career, Defined by the Web

July 5, 2022



On May 13, 2022, at the 7th Annual ICS Hall of Fame Celebration, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) honored its 2022 inductees, including tech entrepreneur Rohit Khare. If you know Khare, it should come as no surprise to see him in the ICS Hall of Fame. The breadth of his knowledge — and his passion for putting that knowledge to practical use — is evident from his impressive resume. After earning dual bachelor’s degrees in engineering and applied science and in economics from Caltech, he started his career as a technical lead for the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Since then, he has helped develop critical internet standards, spent almost a dozen years at Google as a product manager, and launched two successful startups — with a third currently in the works. He credits the research done in ICS as he earned his master’s degree in 2000 and Ph.D. in 2003 as the basis for his three startups: KnowNow in 1999, Ångströ in 2006; and a stealth-mode cloud security startup he is currently working with in Irvine.

Pride Month: Supporting LGBTQ+ in Tech

June 3, 2022



An article published in Science Advances in June 2021, “Systemic Inequalities for LGBTQ Professionals in STEM,” outlines results from a study of 25,000 full-time employed STEM professionals, over a thousand of whom identify as LGBTQ. According to the findings, “LGBTQ STEM professionals were more likely to experience career limitations, harassment and professional devaluation than their non-LGBTQ peers. They also reported more frequent health difficulties and were more likely to intend to leave STEM.”
The article concludes that “STEM workplaces need to include LGBTQ status in their broad efforts toward diversity and inclusion, provide LGBTQ employees with opportunities to network and seek support … and ensure that LGBTQ persons have access to the full suite of formal and informal benefits enjoyed by their non-LGBTQ colleagues.”
