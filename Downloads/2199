APPLICATION PROCESS
APPLICATIONS FOR FALL 2022 WILL OPEN EARLY SEPTEMBER 2021.  
APPLICATION DEADLINE IS DECEMBER 15, 2021.
Step 1:
Fill out the online application. (major code: OCF).
Applications are accepted from Sept. 4 – December 15 each year.
Please note, the Personal History and Statement of Purpose writing sections are part of the online application- please do not send us separate writing samples. Save your application ID and student ID numbers; they will be asked of you when filling out other documents.
Step 2:
Once you have finalized your application in full, press the submit button which then prompts you to pay the $120 domestic application fee ($140 foreign application) using Visa or MasterCard.  Note: application fee cannot be waived. If you have questions regarding your electronic application or your payment, contact UCI Graduate Division at (949) 824-4611 or ogs@uci.edu.
After submitting the application fee, your application will be submitted and you should receive an e-mail confirmation. 
Step 3:

More information about the Letter of Recommendation process can be found here.
Step 4:
Once you have submitted your application, upload your unofficial transcripts from each institution (College/University) you have attended.
For application review purposes only, scan and upload copies of transcripts for all institutions you have attended since high school. In the online application, you will be prompted to upload your scanned documents. Please upload both the front and back sides of the transcript. Uploaded transcripts should be recent and include the following: your name, dates of attendance, grades/marks received, credits and grading legend. Official transcripts will be requested if you have been admitted and accept our admissions offer. Do not send official transcripts until this time.
We require transcripts from ALL institutions (college/universities) attended, not just where you completed your undergraduate degree.
Step 5:
To check the status of your application, you may login with the same email address and password used to create your graduate admission application.
Admissions decisions are ongoing from approximately March through May. Acceptance and denial letters will be sent electronically.
