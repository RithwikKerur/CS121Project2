Policies


As with any degree program, our undergraduate programs are governed by an official set of rules and regulations. Most can be found in the UC Irvine general catalogue. However, there are other policies with which you should familiarize yourself. For instance, it is possible to transfer certain courses taken elsewhere to our undergraduate programs and have those course count towards the degree requirements; change major; or double major. At the same time, you have to be mindful about adhering to posted add and drop deadlines, maintaining academic standing and exhibiting academic integrity.
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences’ Student Affairs Office maintains a list of useful petitions and policies:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/QA_Petitions
Of course, should you have any questions about these policies, you should contact our Student Affairs Office at (949) 824-5156 or our vice chair for undergraduate affairs.
