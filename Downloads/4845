WICS Spring Quarter Week 2: Intuit React Workshop 

 04/11/201809/25/2018admin



On Monday, April 9, WICS held an interactive React Workshop led by Intuit. About 100 people came to DBH 6011 to join in on the fun. First, we learned more about Intuit and what they do. Then Harris, an Intuit representative, led a step-by-step tutorial. Attendees brought their laptops and eagerly coded along, learning more about JS and React on the way. In the end, we had a fully-functional dog quiz app! Those who attended also got to eat great Mediterranean food and get some swag from Intuit. Thank you to everyone who attended, this event was a lot of fun!
