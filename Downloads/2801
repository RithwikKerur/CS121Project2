    				SEraja progress    			


SEraja team is making very good progress.  We are all very excited about our alpha version and are waiting to get feedback from people so we can implement important things and release our open alpha version.    I am very impressed how passionate and engaged are people in this project.  
It is clear that things have changed now in India.  People enjoy developing products.  In 1997 when I was involved in developing a product in a famous company, the culture was different.  This is a big change.
While on this topic, I thought I must share a photo with you that shows how things are changing and how people think of Indian professionals in a different way.  The photo tells a very interesting story.
