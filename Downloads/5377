WICS Winter Quarter Week 2: Mentorship Social 

 01/20/202002/02/2020admin



On Friday, January 17th, WICS hosted a mentorship social for all the mentors and mentees in the WICS mentorship program. The social included a Super Smash Bros Ultimate Tournament, in which 17 participants played, as well as board games and snacks for all the members. The event started with a 1v1 style tournament, which consisted of roughly 20 games, in order to determine the winner of the tournament. The mentors and mentees bonded while playing these various games and enjoyed the relaxing game night. The social wrapped up with taking group photos of the mentorship families to capture the moments from the event.
