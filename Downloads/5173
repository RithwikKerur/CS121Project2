WICS Winter Quarter Week 3: Mock Technical Interview 

 01/23/201902/09/2019admin



On January 22, WICS teamed up with UCI Division of Career Pathways to host our annual Mock Technical Interviews! Many students came by during the day to get some interview experience from real industry professionals. Company representatives from Amazon, Originate, and eBay conducted technical interviews for attendees, asking real questions that are often asked during tech interviews. Interviewees were asked coding questions based on the classes they’ve taken so they can test out their knowledge. At the end of the interview, the company reps gave the students feedback to help them with future interviews. They also had an opportunity to get their resume reviewed by an Amazon rep. This event was a great way for students to practice and get technical interview experience, as well as get immediate feedback from their interviewer. We hope everyone who came felt the event was insightful!
