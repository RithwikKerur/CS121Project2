Online Interactive Teamware Demo, Personal Agenda



Project members' personal Agendas are automatically updated
as Resources become available, Activities become completed,
and Artifacts are passed along.


Notification of project members is completely configurable.
Currently members can be notified of 

assignments 
and 

deassignments by email,  have them 

scheduled on their personal calendar so that conficts can
be resolved immediately, as well as show up on their Agenda.
As a Teamware network executes, certain team members may be
tasked with certain 

decisions about the status of the project
to allow the execution to progress.  These decisions correspond
to conditionals in the Teamware netowrk control flow.
