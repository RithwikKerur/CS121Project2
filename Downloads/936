              I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate ( 2017 - Now ) in Computer Science department at UC Irvine, where I am working with Prof. Shuang Zhao. Before that, I obtained my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from BJUT (2011-2015) and my M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University (2015-2017). I am the recipient of the 2021 Facebook Fellowship. 
              

              My research focuses on physics-based rendering and its inverse problems centered around the inference of geometric and material properties from physical measurements (i.e. photographs, depth data). To develop efficient solutions to the inverse rendering problems, I have been working actively on the topic of physics-based differentiable rendering.
            
I have graduated from UCI as of July 2022. Please check my new WEBSITE for the latest updates.
