    				Person of the Year:  You    			


Time’s Person of the Year 2006 is YOU.Â  Possibly inspired by YouTube and User Generated Content, Time nominated ‘you’ to be the person of the year.Â  This indeed is very interesting and significant.Â  The Web brought democracyÂ – or equal opportunity — in content creation and consumption.Â  Recognition of that is inspiring.
The signifance of this goes beyond the so-called Web 2.0.Â  I see this process of ‘folk-content’Â going towards full-fledged ‘folk computing’.Â  And that will in fact be true equal opportunity — currently it is equal opportunity among priviledged people.Â  This is limited to less than a Billion people out of more than 6 Billion.Â  Extending this YOU to the remaining will be truly great.
