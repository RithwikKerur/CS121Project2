Center Member Awarded $750,000 from IMLS to Study Topic Modeling of Digital Resources Standard

September 1, 2008
News



Center member David Newman and collaborators at Yale University and University of Michigan have been awarded $750,000 from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to study how topic modeling can be used to improve search and discovery of digital resources in increasingly large digital collections. They will apply topic modeling to three important classes of digital library resources: full-text books, images, and tagged objects.  The team will build prototypes of user interface applications that use topic modeling, to assess the value of topic modeling to users.
