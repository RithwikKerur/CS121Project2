Secret Handshakes from CA-oblivious Encryption

ABSTRACT:

	Secret handshakes were recently introduced 
		[BDSS+03] to allow members of the same group to authenticate each 
	other secretly, in the sense that someone who is not
	a group member cannot tell, by engaging some party in the handshake protocol, 
	whether that party is a member of this group. On the other hand, any two 
	parties who are
members of the same group will recognize each other as members. Thus, a secret 
handshake protocol can be used in any scenario where group members need to 
identify each other without revealing their group affiliations to outsiders.

	The work of [BDSS+03] constructed secret handshakes secure under the Bilinear 
		Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). We 
	show how to build secret handshake protocols secure under a more standard 
	cryptographic assumption of Computational Diffie Hellman (CDH), 
	using a novel tool of CA-oblivious public key encryption, which 
	is an encryption scheme s.t. neither the public key nor the ciphertext reveal 
	any information about the Certification Authority (CA) which certified the 
	public key. We construct such CA-oblivious encryption, and hence a handshake 
	scheme, based on CDH (in ROM). The new scheme takes 3 communication rounds like 
	the BDH-based scheme, but it is about twice cheaper computationally, and it 
	relies on a weaker computational assumption.
