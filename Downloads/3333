    				Entrepreneurship education    			


NYT has an article that discusses how entrepreneurship is becoming popular at US universities.
Todayâ€™s students have grown up hearing more about Bill Gates than F.D.R., and they live in a world where startling innovations are commonplace. The current crop of 18-year-olds, after all, were 8 when Google was founded by two students at Stanford; Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004 while he was at Harvard and they were entering high school. Having â€œgrown up digitalâ€ (to borrow the title of Don Tapscottâ€™s recent book on the Net Generation), they are impatient to get on with life.
And these people are creative.  I see that with my students in the entrepreneurship class that I teach and I see that among many young people all around me.  This is exciting.
