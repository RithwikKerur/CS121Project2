    				SEraja Updates    			


It appears that some of you are interested in my periodically providing Seraja updates.  I will start doing that.
SEraja team continues its progress.  
The very early version for Mobile is now available to access.  On your internet connected phone you can go to
m.seraja.com
and access events.  I just did that (currently I am in Washington DC) using my Palm Treo and Verizon service and was pleased to see the  events from different sources (Smithsonian to Bollywood) in Washington today.  Considering that this is the very first version — let’s say like Alpha — it looks great.  I can see that very soon it will start using the location information and present automatically local events.
In about 10 days I will be in Bangalore and will be able to spend some time with the team.  Looking forward to it.

Hi Ramesh,
Just made a post on the blog in regards to the same stuff. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I have some stuff that I’d like to talk to you about. I will write to you on that note.
Regards,
Vijay
