Join Ruha Benjamin in Exploring Discriminatory Designs That Encode Inequity

January 17, 2020



On Feb. 7, 2020, the Department of Informatics is partnering with UCI School of Law in hosting Ruha Benjamin, associate professor of African American studies at Princeton University. This blending of multidisciplinary perspectives is at the heart of Benjamin’s research into the social dimensions of science, medicine and technology and the relationship between innovation and inequity, health and justice, and knowledge and power. Her talk, “A New Jim Code? Race, Carceral Technoscience, and Liberatory Imagination in Everyday Life,” will explore a range of discriminatory designs that encode inequity as she discusses biased bots and altruistic algorithms, challenging participants to more closely examine their own technology designs.

MIT Technology Review: “The Human Screenome Project will capture everything we do on our phones” (Mimi Ito quoted)




“Screen time is a popular carry-over measure from the context of a TV-centered era, developed around health and parenting concerns,” says Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist who studies technology use at the University of California. Even the American Association of Pediatrics, which first popularized the term, has moved away from screen time as a core measure, she says.
