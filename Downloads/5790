Informatics Professors Weave Sustainability into the Fabric of Computing with Comm. ACM Paper

September 27, 2018


“Computing within Limits,” a new paper appearing in the October issue of Communications of the ACM, starts by recognizing that “humanity is rapidly approaching, or has already exceeded, a variety of planet-scale limits related to the global climate system, fossil fuels, raw materials and biocapacity.” And while the authors go on to argue that computing has a significant role to play in responding to such limits, their argument extends far beyond the topic of green IT. In fact, they point out that the LIMITS community of researchers they have built specifically questions green IT’s “implicit assumption that we can ‘engineer around’ the finiteness of the Earth’s resources and waste capacity.”

Informatics Students Partner with Team Kids to Help Children Change the World

September 21, 2018


The Irvine-based nonprofit Team Kids aims to “empower children to change the world.” Its flagship program, the five-week Team Kids Challenge, encourages elementary school children to learn about a critical community issue — such as homelessness, hunger or illiteracy — and to work with local leaders to help address it. Since 2001, Team Kids founder and CEO Julie Hudash has worked to “give young people the opportunity to tackle today’s most critical issues and encourage them to become the next generation of compassionate leaders, entrepreneurs and philanthropists.”

Stew Sutton Enhances Student Learning with Donated Software Licenses

September 19, 2018


Students taking Information Visualization (IN4MATX 143), taught by Professor David Redmiles, have free access to software that they might not realize would normally cost thousands of dollars. Thanks to guest lecturer Stew Sutton, a principal scientist at the Aerospace Corp. who is also a visiting scientist in the Department of Informatics, students can freely use both Tableau and Alteryx, top-of-the-market solutions for discovery-based visual analytics and for data preparation and advanced analytics, respectively. “These are very expensive products that are highly relevant across multiple industries, including healthcare, aerospace, financial services, consumer products, retail and social media services,” says Sutton, who personally reached out to these companies to create a program for higher education.

Quartz: “There are two ways to multitask, but only one works” (Gloria Mark cited)

September 10, 2018


In offices, people get interrupted repeatedly throughout the day. … Interruptions cost the United States an estimated $650 billion a year. University of California, Irvine computer scientist Gloria Mark estimates that it takes 25 minutes, on average, to get back to task! Some people in the study never did.

Educating the Next Generation about Cybersecurity

September 7, 2018


As reported in a recent Information Age article, the global cost of cybercrime could reach $2 trillion by 2019. This highlights the importance of ensuring that computer science students graduate with basic proficiency in cybersecurity. To address this critical need, Professor Sameer Patil at Indiana University (IU) and UCI’s Informatics Professor Hadar Ziv are collaborating to develop new learning modules with funding from their National Science Foundation grant, “Incorporating Sociotechnical Cybersecurity Learning Within Undergraduate Capstone Courses.”

Georgia Tech: “Oh, the Places They’ll Go: Professor Gregory Abowd Looks Back on 30 Ph.D. Graduates” (Gillian Hayes mentioned)

August 21, 2018


Gregory D. Abowd, Regents’ Professor and J.Z. Liang Chair in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia
Tech, has had a profound impact in computing research over his career. In 2018, his 30th PhD student graduated, marking a major academic milestone for Abowd. His academic family extends even further with more than 100 students who have been advised by his graduates at some of the world’s top universities.

Professors Malek and Garcia Aim to Transform Software Architecture Research with $1.66M Grant

August 15, 2018


Informatics Professors Sam Malek and Joshua Garcia recently started working on a three-year $1.66 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The grant, “Constructing a Community-Wide Software Architecture Infrastructure,” is a collaborative project involving faculty from UCI, the University of Southern California and the Rochester Institute of Technology. Malek and Garcia will lead the UCI team, comprised of graduate student researchers working out of the Institute for Software Research (ISR).

A Video Game that Teaches Empathy and Strengthens Neural Connectivity

August 14, 2018


A space-exploring robot crashes on a distant planet. In order to gather the pieces of its damaged space ship, it needs to build emotional rapport with the local alien inhabitants. The aliens speak a different language but their facial expressions are remarkably human-like.

Wired: “If a group text gets read and no one reacts, did it happen?” (Paul Dourish quoted)

August 13, 2018


Reactions on text threads and social media aren’t that different from smiling or nodding while someone is talking. “They are niceties that express that we’re listening, signal interest, and keep the conversation going,” says Paul Dourish, Chancellor’s Professor of Informatics at UC Irvine.

SE-Radio: “Episode 333: Marian Petre and André van der Hoek on Software Design”




Felienne interviews Marian Petre & André van der Hoek on their book Software Design Decoded: 66 Ways Experts Think. We talk about the software design process, which Petre & van der Hoek en discuss about in their book too. While there are a lot of books about software design, their books address designers rather than the design process itself. What do great designers do differently? Petre and van der Hoek distilled 66 insights about design from scientific research, such as ‘experts keep it simple’ and ‘experts try the opposite’. We talk about how to get better at designing, and how to work together on a design as a team of developers.
Listen to the interview at Software Engineering Radio.
