SVN Repository
Location: https://sli.ics.uci.edu/svn/puzzle
User/pass: Same as the wiki
How to access:
From linux: svn co https://sli.ics.uci.edu/svn/puzzle
From windows: Alex recommends the TortoiseSVN gui
Note: from ICS machines, if you can't find svn, you can run: alias svn ~ihler/public/svnkit/jsvn
SVN can do some handy things.  One thing I like is to do is put the text $Id$ in a comment near the top of a file, and SVN will replace it with an informative string like $Id: getFeatures.m 30 2008-10-17 17:34:11Z ajfrank $. To enable this feature, you can
Run the command svn propset svn:keywords Id <yourFile> on the file of interest
Tell SVN to add this property automatically to new files.  In ~/.subversion/config, there is an auto-props section.  It's pretty self-explanatory.
