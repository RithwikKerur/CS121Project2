    				Visual Search: Challenge and status    			


Visual search is becoming increasingly important and will dominate the next frontiers in search technology.  A good aricle on challenges and opportunities appeared in Technology Review.
As in text search, it is not required to develop strong recognition systems, but an approach that could help in bringing in most relevant images based on some syntactically relevant statistical approach.  Text has taught us that theough semantics extraction is still far away, we can perform reasonably efficient search in many applications.
