Ramesh Jain Wins Inaugural IEEE TCMC Impact Award
October 3, 2019 

To foster professional excellence and societal contributions, the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing (TCMC) established three new awards this year: the Impact, Rising Star and Service awards. Winners were recently announced, and the IEEE TCMC Impact Award went to Donald Bren Professor in Information & Computer Sciences, Ramesh Jain, for his “pioneering and wide-spread impact to multimedia computing for the past four decades.”

“When I started championing multimedia, the main applications were multimodal communication,” says Jain. “Now, multimodal processing is central to our personal health — the most important thing for every human being.” His perspective is outlined in an article he coauthored with UCI M.D./Ph.D. candidate Nitish Nag in Computer magazine, “A Navigational Approach to Health: Actionable Guidance for Improved Quality of Life.”
