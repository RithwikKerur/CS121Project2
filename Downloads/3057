    				Revolutionary changes thru inputs    			


In a very interesting article in WSJ, Bill Gates emphasized that r4evokutionary changes in computing will come thru inputs.

Mr. Gates predicted that a “revolutionary” change to computing will come as new ways of inputting data into the computer gradually come into vogue. Included, he said, touch input, speech input, vision input, he said.

This is right on target.Â  And this is already happening.Â  The content is becoming increasingly non-textual and camera phones are leading the revolution.Â  This revolution is taking place at a speed that is fast even when measured in Internet time.Â  The problem is that technology development is not keeping pace with the hardware and infrastructure.
We still don;t have any half-way decent tools for managing photos, video, and audio.
