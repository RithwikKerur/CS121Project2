Disclaimer:
These are guidelines
intended to help students plan their work in this course. However, the
instructor does reserve the right to make changes if needed, including
students' signups. 

Important note:
This class requires a high amount of
coursework.

General
Educational Aims:
Students will
learn and practice the process of user interface design and/or
evaluation. They will learn different methods for user interface
evaluation and experimental design. In real-world projects,
students will have to carefully chose among available
methods and apply them to obtain empirically verified evaluation
results. They will practice collaboration in teams, including the
presentation of the project results in oral
and written form.
 
Specific
Objective:
 At the
conclusion of this course, students should be able to: 
- realize the importance of user-centered design, and formative and
summative evaluation
- choose between different methods for user needs analysis and user
interface evaluation
- select an appropriate design for user studies
- carry out usability experiments
- have attained the ability to evaluate user interfaces of low and
medium complexity 
- have familiarity with some of the outstanding research problems in
the field of Human-Computer Interaction

Prerequisite:
INF 131

Class
format:

Half of the
class will be lecture-format, and the other half will consist of
student presentations on their plans and progress in their projects. Students will collaborate
in teams of 5 to 6,
depending on the total class enrollment and the project requirements.
