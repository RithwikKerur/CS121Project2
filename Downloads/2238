Welcome to the HiER-leap download page. 

HiER-leap utilizes multicore CPUs to accelerate the sampling of single trajectories
of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). 
Additionally, the HiER-leap algorithm utilizes rejection sampling to exactly sample
SSA using a "reaction leaping" method.


The code is written in C++. It requires the libSBML library before being compiled.
It was developed using Mac OS X (v10.6) although other operating systems and environments are expected to work. 
Dependencies

  libSBML 
  Intel Threading Building Blocks 
  BOOST
