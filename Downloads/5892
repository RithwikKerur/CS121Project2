Book 






Starting with Edition 4, I became a co-author of Statistics in Medicine. Originally published by Professor Robert Riffenburgh, Navel Medical Center and former Professor and Head, Statistics Department, University of Connecticut, the text is written to help medical and biomedical investigators design and answer questions about analyzing and interpreting data and predicting the sample size required to achieve useful results. It makes medical statistics easy for the non-biostatistician by outlining common methods used in 90% of medical research. The text covers how to plan studies from conception to publication, what to do with data, and follows with step-by-step instructions for biostatistical methods from the simplest levels, to more sophisticated methods now used in medical articles. Examples from almost every medical specialty, and from dentistry, nursing, pharmacy and health care management are provided.
This book does not require background knowledge of statistics or mathematics beyond high school algebra and provides abundant clinical examples and exercises to reinforce concepts. It is a valuable source for biomedical researchers, healthcare providers and anyone who conducts research or quality improvement projects.
Throughout the text, multiple data sets are used for teaching and explanation.  These data sets can be found and downloaded here.
