WICS Winter Quarter Week 4: Redfin Event 

 01/29/202002/02/2020admin



On Monday, January 27th, WICS invited Redfin representatives to come and participate in an open Q&A session! Around 40 people RSVP’d and roughly 60 people showed up. After everyone settled down and grabbing a slice of pizza, Marissa and Somwya from Redfin answered questions about the gender ratio in their teams, the wage gap between men and women in tech, negotiating offers, and tips for graduating WICS members. They also briefly talked about their experiences as women in the tech field. The panel was then opened to the floor, allowing anyone to ask questions. Afterwards, Redfin chatted with WICS members, reviewed resumes, and joined us in making felt DIY pompom coasters! We were left feeling empowered, and with a new cute coaster!
