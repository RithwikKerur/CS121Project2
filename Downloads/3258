    				Cuil — a new search engine    			


It was expected that some people from Google will try to develop better search engines and one of the new efforts is the search engine CUIL.
I like the look and feel of the results.  Of course Cuil people claim that they search more pages and are much better than Google — I am sure there will be lots of analysis of this.  But one thing is clear, their presentation of results is moving away from the boring list approach.
It will be nice if some clever things are done to the search box also.

There is a new search engine. The new visual search engine, it is only for kids. 🙂
