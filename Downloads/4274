Center Members Receive Major Honors Standard 

A number of Center members were recognized by their peers for major awards in the Fall. Rina Dechter received the 2007 Association of Constraint Programming Research Excellence award. Michael Goodrich was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). And Rui de Figueiredo was elected a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (U.S. Section) and was awarded the academy’s George V. Chilingar Medal of Honor for his important contributions to science and engineering. Congrats to all!

Yahoo! Gift Funds Seminars Standard 

The Center is very grateful for a recent gift from Yahoo! – the gift is specifically targeted at supporting the weekly AI and machine learning seminar series. This series has proven very popular with graduate students and faculty, and we had an excellent set of talks in Fall quarter, including visitors such as Geoff Hinton, Milind Tambe, and Dave Blei. The Distinguished Speaker Series also got off to a great start in the Fall, with talks by Judea Pearl, David Heckerman, and Tommi Jaakkola.  Next quarter, we look forward to visits from Tom Griffiths, Andrew McCallum, and Trevor Hastie.

Center Members Present Six Papers at NIPS 2007 Standard 

At the recent (Dec 2007) NIPS conference in Vancouver, six different papers were presented by PhD students and faculty from the Center. The students included Ian Porteous, Eric Linstead, and Arthur Asuncion, and researchers and faculty from the Center included Alex Ihler, Max Welling, Pierre Baldi, Dave Newman, and Padhraic Smyth. The NIPS conference is one of the major annual conferences in machine learning (over 1000 attendees) and is also highly competitive — only about 25% of submitted papers are accepted.

Paper on Text Mining Selected Among Best Papers at Digital Libraries Conference Standard 

David Newman presented a plenary paper on statistical topic models for indexing large digital libraries in June at this year’s ACM/IEEE  Joint Conference on Digital Libraries. Titled “Subject Metadata Enrichment using Statistical Topic Models,  the paper was selected as one of the 5 best research papers at  the conference,  from over 200 submitted papers. This was joint work with co-authors Chaitanya Chemudugunta and Padhraic Smyth from UC Irvine and Kat Hagedorn from the University of Michigan. The paper appeared in the Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2007),  June 2007.”
