Fall Quarter 2016: Week 3 WICS Games 

 10/10/201611/06/2016Diana Sandil



On the 10th of October, WICS hosted their annual WICS games! There were over 78 attendees who came to our event. Company representatives from Google, ProSky, SendGrid, Facebook, and Pariveda Solutions came to join us in our games. Representatives were separated into different groups with WICS members that competed against one another. We started the first round off by letting each group get to know their own members, having them create a group chant and post a funny picture on WICS social medias. There were three rounds of challenging problems that needed to be solved within a time limit. Near the end of the event, scores were calculated and everyone was given the chance to take home swag. This event was a huge success. Everyone enjoyed the games and had a fun time while also given the chance to meet company representatives and other UCI students. Thank you to all the representatives for playing with us and everyone who joined in on our event!
