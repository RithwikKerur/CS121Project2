Course
Outline
 
This
course is a lab. The goal of the course is to reinforce some of the networking
concepts that were taught in any introductory networking course. The lab is
structured around exercises that highlight topics such as addressing,
subnetting, bridging, ARP, routing (RIP, OSPF), TCP, ICMP, NAT, DHCP, DNS, etc.
The course consists of 10 weeks of networking labs. In lab quizzes are used to
evaluate the students’ understanding of the material and ensure that students
have attempted the lab exercises in the class handouts. Students are required
to review introductory networking material for each lab.  
 
Prerequisites: Introduction to Networking Course
(a strict requirement!)

Class Communication: Piazza Classroom -
Students will be added to a classroom account. All  queries/questions
related to labs and quizzes should be directed thru Piazza to the TA, Reader,
myself and other students. Students are recommended highly to participate in
the Piazza discussions. We will monitor activity and give credit (see grading
below) to those that are vocal and have intelligent and coherent responses. Any
fake or irresponsible participation will have a negative impact.
