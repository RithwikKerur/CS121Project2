We support students to develop career readiness skills, refine career goals, and build professional networks through coordinated services and effective partnerships with faculty, staff, employers and alumni.












Using a student-centered approach, we are dedicated to provide students:

Career Coaching: personalized attention to assist students in identifying career direction and paving their career paths
