Champion Research


Research drives us, but results take resources and impact requires investment.
Supporting Informatics creates a critical funding stream that moves our work forward and leaves a lasting legacy for future generations. We encourage you to consider:

Establishing an endowed chair. Your gift can play a vital role in helping renowned faculty members translate academic research into real-world outcomes.
Making a corporate gift. Your company can partner with us to identify and advance cutting-edge research that is far-reaching and mutually beneficial.
Opening doors. We are always on the lookout for new partners, projects, and opportunities. Through close collaboration, we accelerate dynamic innovation.
Communicating the vision. Informatics has the power to transform the way we live, work, and build in a digital world. You can advance our efforts by sparking conversations about what we do.

Contact our department chair to get involved or learn more.
The Kleists donated $1 million to endow the Robert A. and Barbara S. Kleist Chair in Informatics, which generates funds for Gillian Hayes‘ research in technology, autism and community engagement. Pictured above (from left) are ICS Dean Hal Stern, the Kleists, Hayes and UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman.
