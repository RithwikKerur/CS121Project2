Charles River Analytics Uses Figaro to Develop Probabilistic Tools for US Air Force Satallites (Dechter and Ihler mentioned)
October 30, 2017 Charles River Analytics Inc., developer of intelligent systems solutions, has announced a contract to build probabilistic reasoning tools for the US Air Force. Charles River will use Figaro, its open-source probabilistic programming language for probabilistic modeling, in creating these tools. The twenty-seven month contract for the Probabilistic Reasoning for Enhanced Course of Action Generation system, or PRECOG, is valued close to $750,000. Charles River’s partners on the PRECOG effort include Paul Szymanski of the Space Strategies Center and Professors Rina Dechter and Alexander Ihler of the University of California at Irvine.
