    				ACM Multimedia 2006: Day 3    			


The third day at the conference started with the key note talk by Bradley Horowitz.Â  Bradley argued for social search and Web 2.0 culture.Â  He did make people think about current search approaches in academic community and how those could be applied should be reconsidered.
There were some good technical sessions after that.Â  I attended one where annotation techniques were presented.Â  The final session at the conference was a panel on the status of the field — I was one of the panelists.Â  Panel started with Matthew Turk discussing the 2003 Retreat and its recommendation of three grand challenges.Â  The three grand challenges were:Â  Authoring, Telepresence, and Multimedia Content Indexing.Â  All three are important.Â  You can read more about the retreat here.Â  It said:


The retreat suggested that the community focus on solving three grand challenges: (1) make authoring complex multimedia titles as easy as using a word processor or drawing program, (2) make interactions with remote people and environments nearly the same as interactions with local people and environments, and (3) make capturing, storing, finding, and using digital media an everyday occurrence in our computing environment. The focus of multimedia researchers should be on applications that incorporate correlated media, fuse data from different sources, and use context to improve application performance.

(Disclosure: I was a coauthor of this report.)
As is common, discussion focusses what we are not doing right.Â  This field and the conference has definitely progressed significantly in the last few years and is becoming a vibrant field.Â  One thing is clear, however, that Industry isÂ leading in applications — they are not being influenced by academia.Â  I find that academics always talk about that but the academic culture of strong emphasis — in my opinion over-emphasis — does not allow them to think of short term applications.Â  Currently the gap between what academia does and what industry needs is wide.Â  It is nice to discuss how to reduce the gap, but unless the reward system in academia changes, that is not going toÂ happen.
Now we go to workshops on Friday.Â

One thing is clear, however, that Industry is leading in applications â€” they are not being influenced by academia.  I find that academics always talk about that but the academic culture of strong emphasis â€” in my opinion over-emphasis â€” does not allow them to think of short term applications.
I fully agree, however it will remain like this for a long time.
