About Me





 Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine.
        My advisor is Padhraic Smyth and I am part of the UCI Data Lab. 
        I received a M.S. degree at Columbia University in New York, and a B.S. degree at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, Korea, both in Electrical Engineering.
        I am also either an ISFP 
        or an INFP, or someone in between :P
        





Research Interests





Applications of Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling with focus on text analysis and sequential models, including recurrent neural networks and clickstream analysis.
        Also has experience in text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition (ASR).
