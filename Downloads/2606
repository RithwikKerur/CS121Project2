    				Destinator    			


This had to happen — I am happy that Destinator is now here.  
Essentially, the technology is a mix of services like Yahoo Local (which provides comprehensive listings of local businesses and attractions) and mobile phones incorporating GPS. The idea is that the phone becomes a portable version of the little digital boxes so many car rental companies now offer that can direct drivers to their locations by spouting vocal commands on when to turn left, right or go straight for another quarter-mile.
The idea of having a map as a background data-pad on which to sketch useful services is going to be increasingly popular.  This definitely is a fertile area for innovators and entrepreneurs.
