PmWiki /
BlockMarkup






"Block markup" is a term used in the sources of PmWiki indicating all markups resulting in HTML block elements[1] or in other words multiple paragraphs and other content.

Forms
paragraphs
indent/outdent
lists
list items
headings
divisions and semantic HTML5 elements
images
pre
tables
WikiStyles can be applied to blocks, else you don't need to bother about "blockmarkup" as a PmWiki user.


Division blocks
Division <div> HTML blocks are inserted with the (:div:)...(:divend:) markup. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:div id=id1 class="class1 class2":). A (:div:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag. To have nested tags, you need to number the tag, and the matching tag end: 
(:div:)
Outer block
(:div2:)
Inner block
(:div2end:)
(:divend:)


Semantic HTML5 elements
Since version 2.2.75, PmWiki allows the inclusion of a few semantic HTML5 elements. Note that an opening semantic markup automatically closes any previously opened tag of the same type, but does not verify or tidy the structure for you, so make sure you use closing tags when needed.

(:article:)...(:articleend:)Inserts an <article> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:article id=id1 class="class1 class2":). An (:article:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag. To have nested tags, you need to number the tag, and the matching tag end: 
(:article:)
Outer article
(:article2:)
Inner article
(:article2end:)
(:articleend:)

(:section:)...(:sectionend:)Inserts a <section> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:section id=id1 class="class1 class2":). A (:section:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag. To have nested tags, you need to number the tag, and the matching tag end, like the (:article:) markup.
(:header:)...(:headerend:)Inserts a <header> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:header id=id1 class="class1 class2":). A (:header:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag, and it is not possible to nest such tags. 
(:footer:)...(:footerend:)Inserts a <footer> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:footer id=id1 class="class1 class2":). A (:footer:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag, and it is not possible to nest such tags. 
(:aside:)...(:asideend:)Inserts an <aside> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:aside id=id1 class="class1 class2":). An (:aside:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag, and it is not possible to nest such tags. 
(:address:)...(:addressend:)Inserts an <address> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:address id=id1 class="class1 class2":). An (:address:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag, and it is not possible to nest such tags. 
(:nav:)...(:navend:)Inserts a <nav> tag. You can have the HTML id= and class= attributes like (:nav id=id1 class="class1 class2":). A (:nav:) markup automatically closes a previously open such tag, and it is not possible to nest such tags.
