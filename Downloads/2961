    				Seraja Updates    			


Seraja is making steady progress.Â  You can now upload event reports from mobile phones.Â  As the announcement says:
Â SErajaÂ  Reporter, an application designed for your mobile phone, now enables you to capture and upload multimedia content (images, audio clips, video clips, SMS messages and more) to events on your account on SEraja | The EventWeb (www.seraja.com) anytime, anywhere. Welcome the new age or citizen reporting where the long tail of events and related experiences are as easy to capture, store, share and distribute.
Unfortunately, I don’t have a phone model to check this functionality.Â  So I will have to wait to find somebody who has one to see it working.
(Disclosure: I am a co-founder of Seraja.)
