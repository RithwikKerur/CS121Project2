I. "Toward an Ethics and Etiquette
		for Electronic Mail"
		Shapiro and Anderson, RAND 1985
A. 	Is E-Mail different 
 than other forms of communication?
 1. Some general considerations
		Probably not that much different from 
		real letters and memos
		i.e., no visual cues, no interruptions
		Clearly different from face-to-face
		e.g., JF's bank experience in Jerusalem
		Compare to telephone conversation
		--can interrupt, tone of voice
 2. Speed
		How long to make a connection?
		Is somebody expecting your message?
		Transmission speed
		Comparison media
			letter mail, telephone, face-to-face
 3. Permanence and Privacy
		e-mail has appearance of being temporary,
		but it is really permanent
		"Never say anything in an electronic message
		that you wouldn't want 
		appearing and attributed to you 
		in tomorrow morning's front-page 
		headline in the New York Times."
 
		Leonard White--almost 50 years ago, he
		advised students who worked in 
		Washington DC to
		conduct private conversations on a
		park bench in. LW was a professor of 
		JF.
 4. Cost of distribution
 
		Our comparison three:
		getting a letter typed, stamp
		travel cost
		telephone call cost
	5. Organization's ability to control the medium
		Pretty good on e-mail, especially post-audit
		Copies of letters to boss
			WSJ column--Tues, 26 Sep(see above)
			UC Policy on Electronic Communication
				(we will look at this later)
B. Sending
	1. Keep messages simple
			One subject
			Few recipients
			Identify yourself
	2. Stick to the facts
			Label opinions as such
			Label emotions as such
	3. Assume message will be on "front page..."
			Don't insult or criticize
			Don't send the message
C. Receiving and Responding
 
	1. Emotions
			Flaming--WSJ, Monday, 25 Sep 
				(see above)
			Count to 10
			Look again
			[have to flame to be heard
			nobody to hold you down]
 
	2. Opinions
			Separate opinions from facts
			so you can respond appropriately
	3. Sender, consider the
			Assume honest and competent
			Maybe don't respond to some things
			Courtesy to senders, 
				e.g., you receive a message
				not intended for you
III. E-mail experiences
	A. Grinter's talk on Lucent
		Distributed organization
			24 hour work day
			acquisitions
			low labor cost
	B. JF's experiences
		1. Healthcare Facilitator Advisory Board
			Get some exchanges in face-to-face
			Not much in e-mail
		2. Survey of High-Option Annuitants
			OP draft
			Comments by JF and SM
			How communicated to OP?
			Result--survey
			Result--action
		3. Annuitants comments on bid process
			Ask for comments
			Bundle them up and ship them off
			Did e-mail encourage this strategy?
		4. EAP experience
			Impact of e-mail on director's discretion
II. Carnivore
		FBI program for monitoring e-mail
		Installed at ISP sites
