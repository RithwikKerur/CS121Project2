    				Gesture based image navigation    			


Microsoft developed gesture based image navigation technology but is licensing it to a start-up for commercializing and applying it to specific applications.  Interesting.  
Considering strong activity in gesture-based interaction in the computer vision community, I expect to see many interesting techniques emerge and get into specific apps.
