Winter Quarter 2017 Week 6: Study Session 

 02/15/201703/07/2017Diana Sandil



On Wednesday, February 15th, WICS held its quarterly study session. About 25 members joined us in studying. People were more than happy to help each other, whether it was with studying for midterms or working on homework. In addition to doing schoolwork, everyone had fun talking about life and getting to know each other. As usual, various kinds of pizzas and drinks were provided (bonus: cheesy bread)! Food and study/homework buddies make studying for midterms or doing difficult homework a lot less painful. :)))) Come join us next time!
