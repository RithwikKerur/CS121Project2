    				Religion and Progress    			


I just came back from a wonderful trip to Phuket, Thailand.Â  Spent there two days — too short.Â  Phuket is definitely a very beautiful place to visit.Â  It was quite warm, but the breeze keeps it quite cool.
Â I was quite impressed by arrangements at several places — in particular at a Las Vegas style show place called PhanaSea.Â  Nice show, but the most impressive part was the arrangments.Â  I was quite impressed.
Â One very interesting thing that I have observed in many countries is that the progress is strongly correlated to religiousness.Â  More religious a county, less developed it is.Â  This is quite inresting.Â  Even in USA, this is true based on states.Â  And this makes sense because religiousness shows more conservative society that is reluctant to accept new scientific thiking.
