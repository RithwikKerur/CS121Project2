WICS Fall Quarter Week 7: Intro To Web Dev- Portfolio Workshop 

 11/20/2020admin



On Monday, November 16th, 2020 of Week 7, WICS hosted a web development workshop introducing the basics of HTML and CSS to general members. To enhance the learning experience, we went over the steps for creating and styling a personalized homepage, coding its elements and seeing the results in real time. Attendees were able to get all their questions answered as they followed along with the workshop, creating their own versions of the page. We hope everyone that attended the workshop walks away with some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and wanting to learn more!
