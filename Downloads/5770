Informatics Ph.D. Candidate Daniel Gardner Leads Teams Looking at Representation in Games

July 8, 2020


The general research focus of Informatics Ph.D. candidate Daniel Gardner is the social implications of various interfaces on the periphery of games — interfaces such as character configuration and microtransaction storefronts. “These are the kinds of interfaces that might be considered in the realm of usability, but I look at the ways they mediate different trade-offs for users/players, and sometimes reproduce certain broader inequalities,” says Gardner, who is collaborating with undergraduate and graduate students to advance this work. These partnerships originate from his involvement with the iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3) at the University of Pittsburgh, a leadership program that helps students from traditionally underrepresented groups prepare for graduate school and research professions. Gardner is advising two groups of i3 scholars.

She started that journey four years ago as an inaugural member of UCI’s professional master of human-computer interaction and design (MHCID) program. She closed out the one-year program in 2017 with a capstone project that gave her real-world experience and an internship that helped her get a foot in the door at Alation, where she’s now a senior product designer.
