 ------------------------------------------------------------
Comet Cursor
 
"... a little downloadable program that lets you
replace the dull old Windows arrow cursor
with an image of Kenny from South Park
or other cartoon characters."
but Comet did not tell you that Kenny was telling Comet
"...what Web sites you visited and
what you did while there."
in November, privacy advocates
told on Kenny and Comet
others: Real Networks, AOL
[Wildstrom, Stephen H. On the Web, It's 1984, BusinessWeek,
10 Jan 00, 28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banks
 

Banks used to know their customers.
Then they got bigger.
Then they encouraged customers
to do fewer face-to-face transactions.
Now banks want to use their data
to get to know their customers.
----------------------------------------------------------

How do they do this?
 
Selling customer information to telemarketing firms
Data mining is the really big activity
To get customers to buy other products
Monitor customer activity
Banks didn't like it when feds proposed it
Software designed to help banks comply
 
with proposed federal regs
now being used for marketing
Bank of America is going to install this software
Monitoring credit card activity is another
part of the program
So are banks being helpful in making suggestions?
Or are they violating your privacy?

"Some Health Care Web Sites Lack Privacy"
[Alissa J. Rubin, LA Times, 2 Feb 00, A3, A27]
Report by California Healthcare Foundation
HCWS claim that health info will not be shared
 
"... often it is picked up by companies
that advertise on Internet sites."
E.g., somebody logs on to find out about diabetes
and information about that person and the query can be sold
17,000 Health Web sites
"Of the about 110 million Internet users,
about 25 million have visited health Web sites."
---------------------------------------------------------------
DoubleClick
Double Click is an Internet advertising agency
"Its computers insert banner ads and other
 
promotional messages on about 1,500 Web sites."
Double Click uses cookies to collect information
 
to enable it to target customers.
DC has about 100 million profiles.
    Until last Fall DC provided only anonymous data
to marketers.
 
Then DC put together the cookie information with
other information to associate names and addresses
with the cookie info. In November DC bought a data
warehouse company that had information on names
and addresses.
So DC now knows what you do online, who you are,
where you live, and your phone number.
On 27 January, Harriet Judnick filed suit against DC
[Green, Heather, Alster, Norm, Borrus, Amy, and Yang, Catherine.

[DoubleClick's response]
 DoubleClick Moving to Quell Consumer Privacy Criticism
Greg Miller, LA Times (OC), 15 Feb 00, C1, C8
 Privacy Advocates Fault New DoubleClick Service.
Jeri Clausing, NY Times, 15 Feb 00, C2
 

 Formal Complaint to Federal Trade Commission
by leading privacy group saying that DC "...was
collecting personal information from Web sites
that claimed such information was not being shared."
 Five-point privacy initiative
 DC "... would require that all sites with which
it does business post clear, effective policies
stating what information is gathered
and how it is used."
 Hire privacy officer
 Create a privacy advisory board
 Hire Pricewaterhouse Cooper to audit data collection
 New Website: www.privacychoices.org--opt out
 
 Not nearly enough say privacy advocates

Tell people what you have on them like credit reports
"Opt in" is better than "Opt out"
 Is this an effort by DC to try to avoid legislation

How much are feds doing?

How did we get into this situation?

The pre-computer era
 
Credit bureaus
JF's bank experience
The computer era
 
Big credit bureaus
Government matching
The internet era
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
So what can you do to protect yourself?
 
"use PGP or another strong encryption method
do not use your employer's computer system
for personal messages and messages
you do not want your employer to read, and
choose a service provider who contractually
gives on-line users strong privacy rights."
[The Legal Right to Privacy in Electronic Communication.
Timothy Stanley. The CPSR Newsletter, Fall 1995]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So what should you do to protect yourself?
Extreme solution
 

 Pay cash
 Don''t use internet
 Don't use your computer for e-mail
 

 
------------------------------------------------------------
 
What should responsible organizations do?
What should the government do? Can we trust them?
