Spring Quarter 2017 Week 1: General Meeting 

 04/17/2017Vivian Thach



On April the 5th, WICS hold the first general meeting of the Fall quarter. During this event, WICS presidents Janay and Katie introduced the club, the events we host, and the board members and committee members. The attendees enjoyed delicious pizza from Dominos and Soda.  After the meal, we played team building games. The attendees are spread into several groups. Then we got asked questions such as the number of siblings we have, and the brands of our shoes. We sorted ourselves according to the answers to the questions. The quickest team was awarded swags.  The event was a great success. We meet lots of new people. Thanks for everyone attending the event. We are looking forward to seeing you again!
