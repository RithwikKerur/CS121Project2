    				Becoming Impatient    			


Is it that I feel that way or does it have something to do with the aging process?
I feel that in my impatience is slowly increasing.  At one time I was quite patient with people and used to tolerate things easily that I really did not like and I did not need to tolerate.  In the last few years, I find that I am becoming increasingly impatient with myself and with things around me.  I still control myself, but find myself fuming inside and sometimes becoming a bit rude to people.
And a fact is — I don’t even feel bad about it.  I feel as if that is how one should behave.  One has limited amount of time in life and hence one should only waste so much on being nice.  More time should be spent in doing what is right and what you enjoy that being polite and nice to people.

I think it’s a symptom of the culture we live in today – advances in technology mean that we no longer have to wait for things we once did. I think in many ways it’s a shame, but I too find myself getting agitated if a process takes longer than usual, whether that’s loading a web page or a train running later than scheduled. I’m not sure that things will improve in the near future either.

Where do you think the saying “grumpy old man” comes from?  I think it’s definitely part of aging-you don’t feel the need to be nice and polite all the time.  I knew you were becoming a grumpy old man!

Hah!  I prescribe a daily glass of red wine, a game of chess, and 30 minutes bowling.  Won’t affect the impatience quotient in the slightest, but impatience isn’t the problem here, is it.
