    				Emerging art of storytelling    			


We are living in the age of transformations.  Even the most ancient and most popular art, the art of storytelling, is being transformed by the emerging technology, particularly first by Computers and now by Mobile Phones.  My research in the last few years has been related to some aspects of storytelling using emerging technology.  Storytelling plays a very central role in human life and society.  The nature of storytelling is closely related to how we communicate, how cultural traditions are formed, how we learn and educate, and how we entertain.  This white paper is the result of my observations in this fascinating area.  I would love to hear your comments and suggestions on this.
Here is a link to the white paper: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5644217/Extreme%20Stories%20120902.pdf
