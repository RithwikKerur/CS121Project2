Tenure-Track Faculty Position
Digital Games and Interactive Media
The Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine is seeking exceptional candidates for a tenure-track position in digital games and interactive media. We recognize the importance of digital games and interactive media to society and the economy, and wish to complement our existing areas of excellence with a strong presence in these emerging areas.
The department is strongly interdisciplinary, with faculty backgrounds in anthropology, computer science, engineering, humanities, media arts, organizational studies, and psychology. This, in no small measure, contributes to our strong international reputation as an innovative site for research and education on information technology and its applications. We wish to add a similarly interdisciplinary perspective on digital games and interactive media, their role in society, and new possibilities for innovative design.
Our search is intentionally broad. We appreciate work of all varieties, whether empirical, technological, methodological, or analytical in nature. Game technologies, games studies, games and learning, AI for games, games for health, procedural content generation, games and digital media, augmented and/or mixed reality gaming, virtual worlds, game design, and critical game-making are all examples of topics well within the scope of the search.
For three years in a row, UC Irvine has been ranked as the best U.S. university under 50 years old by Times Higher Education.  In 2015, it was ranked the #1 green university by Sierra Magazine in its sustainability report on U.S. colleges and universities, and was ranked the #1 school in the nation in doing the most for low-income students by The New York Times.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in a relevant field and exhibit a compelling research portfolio as well as a clear vision for teaching.  Senior applicants should also demonstrate a proven track record in funded research activities. Salary and other compensation (including priority access to on-campus faculty housing) are competitive with the nation’s finest public universities.
Each application must contain: a cover letter, CV, up to three key publications, a statement of research and teaching interests, and 3-5 letters of recommendation.  A separate statement that addresses past and/or potential contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion must also be included.  All materials must be uploaded at:
https://recruit.ap.uci.edu/apply/JPF03177
The position is approved at the Assistant Professor level, though exceptional candidates at all ranks will be considered.
The position is for appointment in July 2016.  Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, although maximum consideration will be given to applications received by January 8, 2016.
The University of California, Irvine is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer advancing inclusive excellence. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, age, protected veteran status, or other protected categories covered by the UC nondiscrimination policy.
