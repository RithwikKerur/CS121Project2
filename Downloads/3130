    				Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative Workshop    			


Listening to talks on Cultural History Atlas groups in many countries was a very interesting experience.Â  This group of researchers is interested in creating cultural history of different regions in the world.Â  Obviously, history is a sequence of events.Â  This group has been using GIS tools and timeline tools and are interested in finding ways to represent relationships among events, including causality.Â  
Â 
I presented a talk on EventWeb and its application.Â  You can see my presentation here.Â  They understood the concept of event as I have been proposing without any difficulty.Â  And they showed lot of interest in using these tools.Â  They saw many applications in different contexts.
Â 
Obviously I was very pleased about the reaction.Â  It will be great to get some rich data sets on Seraja software and run different experiments.Â  Their data sets are all related to events and have lots of experiential data in addition to informational data.
