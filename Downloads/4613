Professor Franz’s Research Group Invited to Present at Black Hat USA 2020
May 11, 2020 
UCI’s work on “NoJITsu: Locking Down JavaScript Engines” by Taemin Park, Karel Dhondt, David Gens, Yeoul Na, Stijn Volckaert, and Michael Franz has been invited for presentation at Black Hat USA 2020 in August. Now in its 23rd year, Black Hat USA is the world’s leading information security event, providing attendees with the very latest in research, development and trends. Every year Black Hat USA brings together about 20,000 attendees, including C-suite representation from virtually every company in the Fortune 1000/Global 1000. Presenting at Black Hat in front of this illustrious audience is a rare honor that demonstrates UCI’s relevance in this space.





The pictures show scenes from a previous Black Hat taken by Professor Franz, featuring a keynote by Facebook’s Chief Information Security Officer.
