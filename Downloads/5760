Gizmodo: “How Has Social Media Impacted Our Mental Health” (Mimi Ito quoted)

August 16, 2021


How has social media actually impacted mental health, per the research? For this week’s Giz Asks, we reached out to a number of experts to find out. According to UCI Professor Mimi Ito:
“At the Connected Learning Lab, we’ve been doing studies of how social media can both support wellbeing for young people as well as detract from it. On the plus side, most young people will say that social media and networked games are a lifeline to supportive connections with friends and loved ones. This was critical during the pandemic when schools and sports were off limits. Social media can also be a way for young people to connect with others with shared interests and identities, which can be a lifeline for youth with marginalized or stigmatized identities such as LBGTQ+ youth or racial and religious minority youth. On the negative side, depending on the spaces they frequent, youth can encounter harassment or unhealthy body image expectations.

CHOC to launch pilot study on speech therapy app that UCI students helped develop

August 10, 2021


The CHOC Research Institute plans to launch a pilot study on a pediatric speech therapy application that senior undergraduate students at UC Irvine’s School of Information and Computer Science (ICS) developed this past academic year.
CHOC sponsored the students’ work under the supervision of Professor Hadar Ziv, an associate professor in the Informatics Department at the Donald School of Information and Computer Science, and Dr. Brian Cohn, Ph.D., co-founder of Adventure Biofeedback and a former student of CHOC Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Terence Sanger.

The New York Times: “New Policy Aims to Help Transgender Researchers Update Names on Old Work” (Theresa Jean Tanenbaum quoted)

July 31, 2021


Theresa Jean Tanenbaum, an associate professor in the department of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, welcomed the news.
Her work had been published in several journals before she changed her name in 2019. Pushing each publisher to update their records accordingly has been a long and painful process, Dr. Tanenbaum said. Some of the objections she encountered stemmed from editors’ reluctance to “rewrite history,” or from concerns that name changes might open the door to fraud.
She founded the Name Change Policy Working Group in hopes of easing the name-changing process for others.
“Many trans people find their previous name harmful,” she said. “And the act of disclosing a trans person’s previous name is often used to attack us.”

ComicBook: “Cartoon Network Partners With Raising Good Gamers to Promote Positive Online Gaming”

July 13, 2021


Cartoon Network has partnered with Raising Good Gamers, an initiative by Games for Change and Connected Learning Lab at the University of California, Irvine, to “inspire kids to stop bullying before it starts by creating more positive online gaming communities.” The announcement came as part of a larger slate of pro-social youth programs during the 2021 Games for Change Festival this week, which includes a collaboration with the TED-Ed Student Talks program as well as a series of youth workshops. But the Cartoon Network partnership is the only one that has Gumball from The Amazing World of Gumball and BMO from Adventure Time.

Professor Theresa Tanenbaum Wins Dynamic Womxn of UCI Award for Social Justice Activism

July 7, 2021



In early 2019, when Informatics Professor Theresa Jean Tanenbaum first started compiling all of her work for tenure consideration, she had no idea that her efforts would lead to recognition at the 2021 Dynamic Womxn of UCI Awards event. At the May 2021 ceremony, Tanenbaum received an Outstanding Social Justice Activist award, which “honors individuals that have demonstrated a commitment to working on anti-sexist endeavors and who work to end multiple forms of oppression.”
How did the tedious yet routine process of trying to earn tenure put Tanenbaum on a path to receiving an anti-sexist activism award? Her journey starts with a name change.

Informatics Professor Paul Dourish Named Steckler Endowed Chair

July 6, 2021



As the UCI community continues to mourn the loss of beloved alumnus Vincent Steckler, who led the tremendous growth of Avast Antivirus Software during his time as CEO, solace can be found in seeing the impact of his legacy. Steckler, who graduated from UCI in 1980 with a B.S. in information and computer science and a B.S. in mathematics, was a dedicated advocate for socially responsible technology. As announced in January, a generous gift from Steckler and his wife, Amanda, led to the creation of the Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical and Accessible Technology (CREATE) in UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences (ICS). Funding from that gift also helped establish the Steckler Endowed Chair, with Chancellor’s Professor of Informatics Paul Dourish taking on that role effective July 1, 2021.

The Resilience of the Class of 2021

June 24, 2021


UCI’s 56th annual commencement, though not unique in marking the university’s now second ever virtual ceremony, nevertheless represented something extraordinary. “The class of 2021 will have a unique place in our institutional memory as the most resilient and responsive class we have ever had the privilege of teaching,” said Chancellor Howard Gillman during his opening remarks. “Under the most extraordinary circumstances, you rose to the occasion, supported each other, adapted and persisted.”
