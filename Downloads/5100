Summer 2022: Lunch with the Mayor 

 07/13/2022admin



On Saturday, June 25, 2022, WICS members attended the “Lunch with the Mayor” event, hosted by Live Good. Live Good is a student-run, environmentally-friendly company in Irvine that focuses on education, diversity, and promoting social good through their business model, sustainable products, and humanitarian projects. During the event, WICS members met with the mayor of Irvine, Farrah Khan, along with other Irvine civic representatives, and shared lunch and conversation about contemporary topics which included the history and future of Irvine, transportation, city planning, and the careers of the attendees. Needless to say, our WICS representatives enjoyed the event and learned about the behind-the-scenes management of the city that they study in!
