    				Computing in 100 BC    			


NYT reports on Antikythera Mechaism that could be considered analog computing in 100 BC.  Interesting that:
the device not only predicted solar eclipses but also organized the calendar in the four-year cycles of the Olympiad, forerunner of the modern Olympic Games.
So human quest for computing has truly been very old.
