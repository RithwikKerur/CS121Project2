    				Geotagging    			


Flickr has made Geotagging popular.Â  The potential of Geotagging is definitely there and it is also sure that GPS will come to cameras — it is only a matter of time.Â  By adding time and location to pictures, the browsing of photos will become definitely lot more effective.Â  There is a great report on that in News.com — see here.

Cell phones already have camera built in, and will have GPS soon.  It can get there sooner than camera, or may be your vision is closer than the article predicts. 🙂

I believe — for common usage — cameras and phones will become one and they have all basic features of cameras (exif standards).  I think it is a matter of 2 years or so when GPS will be more commonly available.

I think we are definitely moving towards devices that have multiple uses – as has been said we already have camera phones, it is only a matter of time before GPS is included in the package and who knows what else. I believe this will happen sooner rather than later.

We are already using GPS systems in Cars for navigation purposes and everyone knows that GPS is extensively used in military operations, so days are not that far when we will start using it in our frequent used appliances like mobiles, PDA’s etc.
But one thing that will be the cause of concern is the ‘security’ issue related to use of GPS in common man’s operations. Hopefully something will  come out to eradicate this threat as well.
