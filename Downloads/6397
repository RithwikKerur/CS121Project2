Seventh Homework







INFORMATICS 41 • DAVID G. KAY • UC IRVINE • FALL 2011
 Seventh Homework 

This assignment is due in lab next week. Try to do it
by Monday, but expect that it will generate some questions
that you'll need to get answered before you can finish it.
(1) Read Chapter 29, which talks about sequential programming and input/output, topics we've been doing since the first restaurant program. You can skip sections 29.5, 29.6, and 29.7.
(2)  At http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/DeusXercises.pdf there are a couple of problems that will give you some concrete practice
  with machine-level programming.  Download the file, do the problems, and
  turn them in (on paper) to the TA at the start of lab on Monday, if possible.  Each of
  you should submit a solution individually because everyone should get the
  practice of working through the steps.  But feel free to work together and
  help each other out.  

We almost certainly will ask a question about machine
  language and the Deus X on a quiz and on the final.  If we do, we will provide
  a copy of the Deus X Instruction Set sheet; it would be nuts to expect anyone
  to memorize it.
