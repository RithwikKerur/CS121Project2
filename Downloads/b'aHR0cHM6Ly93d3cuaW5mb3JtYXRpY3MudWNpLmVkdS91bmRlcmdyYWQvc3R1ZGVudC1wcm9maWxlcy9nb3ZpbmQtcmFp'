Business Information Management
Why did you choose UC Irvine?
The UC houses some of the world’s best-designed educational programs. I always knew I wanted to be part of a program that meshed business and technology, and UC Irvine was the only UC offering an interdisciplinary program like business information management.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
Having the access to an extensive and valuable student and professional network through the BIM major’s dual administration by the Paul Merage School of Business and The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. Whatever your strong point, computer science or business, being disciplined under both schools will help you build key connections that will help you excel beyond the educational sphere (i.e. startups,
competitions, friends). The term “best of both worlds” truly applies here.
Have you done an internship?
I’ve been fortunate enough to complete two: a product management & marketing
internship with Thales Avionics; and a technology consulting internship with Protiviti. I helped Thales launch an internal fileshare portal geared to assist the Thales sales team to effectively collaborate and share important documents when helping airline carriers make business decisions. At Protiviti, I performed critical business-risk controls testing surrounding privacy and security and helped deliver value-creating recommendations and solutions to their clients.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
Since fall quarter of freshman year I have been heavily involved with the Management Information Student Society (MAISS). I made my first friends at UC Irvine through this organization and I have carved a big portion of my college and professional career from the relationships and people I have met there. I served as MAISS president for the 2013-2014 academic year. I am also part of a leading professional business fraternity, Lambda Phi Nu. Joining LPhiNu has expanded my network to some of UC Irvine’s top, most-talented students. The organization has significantly helped me shape my future career goals and has given me the opportunity to develop relationships with my fellow brothers I hope will last a lifetime. I have served many roles in this organization and currently am a member of the Executive Committee.
What are you most proud of so far?
I am proud of what UC Irvine has become in my three years here and the direction the university is heading. The caliber of students and faculty I have had the chance to interact with at UC Irvine is beyond phenomenal. UCI is consistently recognized as a world-class university, is placed in top rankings, and offers amazing extracurricular programs such as Paul Merage Business Plan Competition and Donald Bren Butterworth & Beall Competitions that help set apart UC Irvine and its students from the thousands of other universities and programs out there. Oh, and Barack Obama spoke at our 2014 graduation, too!
What has been the best part of your experience?
There are lots of challenges that will come up throughout your college experience and there will be a lots of things you will learn about all facets of your life: academic, social and professional. Overcoming these challenges (placing in a competition, finishing a complex programming assignment, landing my first internship, etc.) has been very, very rewarding and has greatly added to a phenomenal experience so far at UC Irvine.
What are your aspirations?
I want to eventually open my own technology startup. If not, I definitely want to immerse myself in the startup environment in the near future. I also envision myself returning to school in 5-8 years to complete a master’s degree in business administration.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
Whenever you have the opportunity, go out and meet as many individuals as possible. Often times referred to as “networking,” it will help you find your friends, your study buddies, your mentors — and maybe even your business partners. It’s not about knowing everyone, it’s about the few individuals you’ll end up meeting who will truly expand your network and be valuable to you. There are a lot of smart people out there who have a lot of knowledge and who can mentor you and help you become the person you want to be. Your network will end up influencing your entire college career so make sure you duly invest in your relationships. Don’t waste your precious time at home or in your dorm room! Above all, always be positive around everyone and be nice. That will go a long way.
