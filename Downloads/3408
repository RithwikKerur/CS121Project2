    				Where is Computer Science in it?    			


Being a researcher, I have many very analytical and accomplished computer scientist friends.  In my academic circles, particularly with students, my friends usually ask: Where is computer science in it?
I find this question very amusing because Computer Science, like many other disciplines, is a growing area. Conservatives always try to define their discipline closer to the core that existed about 100 years ago and liberals try to take you to the so called fringes.  So in computer science when my friends ask this question they are referring to questions that their discipline — say databases– was trying to address some time ago.  On the other hand, my liberal friends consider disciplines like bio-informatics or web science as core computer science.  So which CS are we taking about?  Interestingly, many disciplines  — the whole disciplines like Databases — were not considered respectable disciplines in their early stages by the then conservatives of the field.  
To me more important question is — what problem are we trying to solve.  And if it is a useful problem, then it does not matter whether it is computer science or cognitive science or chemical science.  If it belongs to a particular specific current domain, then good; if it does not belong to any of those, so be it – we will help people and society by solving this any way.  And who knows, in the process may create a completely new and useful discipline like the Web. 
So young researchers should first select an important problem to solve and then only — secondarily — worry where it belongs.

Thanks for the  post.It was nice reading it.I have taken a cue from this post.You are right..it is important to select a problem first and then try to analyze it.Look forward to more such useful posts from you.

Regardless of the required discipline providing relevant content, solid structure and functionality to the end user should be paramount. We enjoyed your post, thank you.

When compared with all the other sciences, Computer Science and IT were just recently recognized for their importance in complementing different study fields. But today, it is clearly one of the most challenging research areas. Although computers are the most visible feature of computer science, it wouldnâ€™t be accurate to characterize it as dealing only with machinery. For that matter, a more comprehensive definition would be the study of computation, which includes information processing from designing and analyzing algorithms to the development of computational devices and execution of those programs. Having this kind of expanded knowledge could benefit the accuracy of results in research processes for new technologies and its holistic analysis. Nevertheless, computing strategies must operate along with high performance machinery. Since the organization depends on computers, it is essential to have a reliable provider of technology solutions. I would recommend a consultation with Ask Dr. Tech. Their professionals can provide the best IT solutions, any place at any time. Their work relies on outsource services and remote operations, which are clearly required at any government instance.

Computers aren’t even 100 years old.  I can only imagine the number of new programming languages we will see in the future.  We are getting closer to where we just snap widgets together and they all work seamlessly.
