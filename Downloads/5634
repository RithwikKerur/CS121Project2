← Student Life  Housing  	




Housing


Having a comfortable place to live is important to a great experience during your studies. Many of our students choose to live on campus, as UC Irvine provides high-quality housing and facilities that are conveniently located and create a strong sense of community. However, quite a few of our students find off-campus housing in nearby cities such as Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, and Long Beach to get the full experience of what life is like in Southern California.
The housing office maintains an extensive website describing on-campus housing options, policies, and rules and regulations.
For those interested in living off-campus, the following link provides useful information to get started.
Whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student, UC Irvine offers great options for both on-campus and off-campus housing.
