Peyman Tehrani 



Research Interests: 
Reinforcement LearningFederated LearningOptimizationWireless NetworksSignal Processing



Education:
2017 –  Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA2013 – 2016 M.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran2009 – 2013 B.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran

Bio:
Peyman Tehrani received his B.S. and M.S degree in Electrical engineering  from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2013 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, he was a student visiting researcher for six months at the University of Padova, Italy. Since Fall 2017, he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in Networked Systems under the supervision of Prof. Marco Levorato, with a focus on the application of deep reinforcement learning and federated learning for the distributed control of wireless systems and smart energy networks. He interned with Qualcomm Inc. in summer 2020 as a Machine learning-Wireless system Intern, working on the using deep learning algorithms for channel prediction in 5G networks.
