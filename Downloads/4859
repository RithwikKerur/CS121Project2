Spring Quarter 2017 Week 2: Intro to Command Line Workshop w/ Hack 

 04/17/2017Vivian Thach



On the 12th of April, WICS in collaboration with Hack at UCI hosted a Command Line workshop.  Over 50 attendees joined us at the Calit2 Auditorium that evening.  Before the workshop began, attendees, club officers, and mentors chatted outside the auditorium eating delicious Costco pizza as our hard-working WICS committee were signing people into the event.  After finishing our meals, we continued inside the theater-like auditorium and began setting up our machines for an insightful workshop.  Three Hack mentors developed a step-by step curriculum in preparation for the attendees to learn the basics of Command Line.  Throughout the duration of the workshop, Hack representatives encouraged all questions to be asked which allowed the audience to remain very attentive and focused.  The event was a huge success.  We all learned a lot about the Command Line, a crucial tool for navigating through your system’s files and directories.  Thanks for everyone who came out and we look forward to seeing you all again!
