    				Image Search — Retrievr    			


On Arun Katiyar’s suggestion, I played with retrievr.
Very impressive and cool.  Good direction for image search.
A good reason for success here is the fact that this approach uses some image primitives (I’d love to know exactly what they use) but does not get into semantics.  Clever approach — similar in spirits to keyword based approaches in search engines.  Now the trick is to improve this enough so people can see their semantics in these results.

			One thought on “Image Search — Retrievr”

Apparently Retrievr uses Fast Multiresolution Image Querying (http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/query/), as pointed by one of the author (hris langreiter) in a comment on this post: http://battellemedia.com/archives/002179.php
