    				Back home    			


I have never been out so long from US — left on July 27th and came back on Sept 14th.Â  I entered US first time on Janyary 13th 1978 and have never been away for more than a month or so.Â 
Singapore was great, but coming home feels really sweet.Â  But no time to (poor) me — have to go to Ban Jose this week ad then in exactly a week from this moment to leave for Germany.Â  Well that’s the price you have to pay for being curious and want to do interesting things.
