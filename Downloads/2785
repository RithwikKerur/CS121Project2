    				Too much travel    			


Today is first day of this period of hectic travel.  From now till April 9th I am travelling a lot.  Currently on my way to India then to Germany then back and to Atlanta, Washington, and Jacksonville (Florida).  And I am not a fan of travelling.  Unfortunately it will not stop there the travels will be less w=but continue in April and May and then June also.  Does not seem to end.  Well as they say a man got to do what a man got to do.
