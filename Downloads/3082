    				Wow factor in photo technologies at Microsoft    			


Microsoft research group always ahd a strong image processing/computer vision component.Â  They now have a strong WoW technology in:
HD View is one photo project that definitely has the “wow” factor. The technology allows users to combine hundreds of photos to create one massive picture that users can zoom in on to see clear details. In one example, a panoramic photo of the city of Seattle includes 800 images, each 8 megapixels in size, stitched together to create a 3.6 billion-pixel image.
Commercial apps may come sooner or later, but such technology definitely has a very strong appeal.
