Strava Map Exposes Weaknesses in Understanding Complexities of Pervasive Data

February 20, 2018


It was recently reported that Strava unknowingly revealed U.S. military bases when it produced a heat map showing the movement of people around the world who use its exercise-tracking app. In reviewing the map, a college student from Australia realized that he could locate military bases in counties such as Iraq and Syria, where the app was almost exclusively used by American soldiers.
This prompted the U.S. military to review its security practices, and it renewed talks of privacy concerns, but according to Informatics Professor Matthew Bietz, “privacy is probably the wrong framework here.” The issue is much more complex.

Novel AR/VR Theater Class Builds Foundation for New Traditions in Theater

February 12, 2018


“What new experiences can we create?” Informatics Professor Theresa Jean Tanenbaum presents this question to the 22 students enrolled in Informatics 295/190: AR/VR Theater, a new course he is teaching in collaboration with Broadway/film producer and director and UCI alumnus Tim Kashani. The question isn’t theoretical or merely an exercise in imagination. The experimental class will develop three augmented and virtual reality theater projects for use by Apples & Oranges Studios, a company founded by Kashani and his wife, Pamela, that develops and produces new musicals in cutting-edge ways.

Julius Baer Vision Magazine: “The Familiar Faces of Interfaces” (Gillian Hayes quoted)

February 2, 2018


In her lab, Professor Hayes is working on tangible interfaces for blind
people that focus on interactions based on an augmented sense of
touch. Instead of using a screen reader to describe a visual interface,
which makes technological interaction difficult for the blind, one of
her projects in this area focuses on the development of a motorised
virtual scroll bar. Among other things, this scroll bar gives different
levels of resistance depending on the size of a document. “So, if it is a
short document, [you feel] light resistance, and you can pull quickly
down,” she explains. “Longer documents have more resistance so it
feels like the scroll bar is bigger than it is.”
