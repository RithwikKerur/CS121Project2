    				Amusing event in religion-politics in India    			


It is amusing to see how religion and politics play and how politicians have to change facts — and history — in the interest of votes.Â  Read this article about Government of India’s position on Ramayana being history (or not). Also seeÂ the bbc report.
This is an interesting incidence in ‘modern’ India.
