    				Long Tail using Recognition by Crowds    			


Virginia Heffernan says in NYT
Et tu, YouTube? The mellow Silicon Valley â€œvideo-sharing site,â€? once styled as nothing more than a converted loft space for oddball videos, is looking more Hollywood by the minute. Back in the day, say, six months ago, YouTube was still meant to be pure NoCal: no judgments, no hierarchies, big bandwidth and lots of freedom. YouTube videographers werenâ€™t supposed to get stars on their doors from the powers that be.
I find that most sites that start with the idea to encourage long tail, start using mechanisms to make some of the tail elements head.Â  Clearly tail can not survive without head.
And about the reward system, she adds:
This value system is not intrinsically worse than the one that determines prime-time televisionâ€™s crisp, white-collar aesthetic; its mainstream politics; and its chronic oscillation between punchy and sappy. Itâ€™s just that YouTubeâ€™s not really supposed to have any aesthetic or ideological principles, is it? YouTubeâ€™s video superlatives might make you think that Google might one day hand out prizes for best or shadiest Web site. Or that Wikipedia might honor the most brilliant idea. YouTube, Google and Wikipedia should be low-key clearinghouses of shared information. Not prosceniums.
