    				Seraja update 061220    			


Today was my last day with the seraja team.Â  Seraja is now a very exciting system — a strong and powerful event based back-end and extensive Web 2.0 features for User Generated content and community building.Â  The system is now ready for use by people in many different applications.Â  For us — the Seraja team — the challenge is now to spread the word about how useful and exciting the system is.Â  And this is not an easy task.Â  We will have to work on it.Â  And this is our challenge.
Before the new year starts, I am going to take a mini break — call it vacation.Â  I start on it beginning tomorrow when I go to Kerala and then I will be in Nagpur from December 24th evening.Â  I am looking forward to this.Â  It is great that this is starting at such a positive note.
