General Policies

 Students with Disabilities.
Any student who feels that he or she may need an accommodation based
on the impact of a disability should contact 
Dr. Goodrich to
discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact
the UCI Disability Services
Center, at (949)824-7494, as soon as possible to better ensure
that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
 Lectures. Copyright Â© 2021

Michael T. Goodrich, as to all course lectures, with all rights reserved.
Students are prohibited from 
recording the audio or video content of lectures and from
selling (or being paid for taking) notes during his courses to or by any
person or commercial firm without the express written permission of Dr.
Goodrich.

Cheating.
Group work on homeworks is permitted in courses only if it is 
specifically allowed.  Moreover, even if group work is allowed, each
student must list his or her collaborators in writing for each assignment.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
Exam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration
is allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams
will be considered cheating.
In addition to the procedures of the
ICS
Cheating Policy, any student caught cheating on exams will be given
a failing grade in the class.
