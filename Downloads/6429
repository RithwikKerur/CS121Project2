INFORMATICS 41 • DAVID G. KAY • UC IRVINE • FALL 2011
 Past Quizzes 
This is the complete set of Informatics
41 quizzes from   Fall 2004 through Fall 2010. 
 These quizzes are the best guide available
  to the kinds of questions we might ask on this quarter's quizzes, but
  they are not a perfect match.  We may cover topics at a different
  pace, in a different order, or of an entirely different nature; that means
  that Quiz N on this list will not be an exact match for what's on Quiz
  N this quarter.  Look at Quiz N+1 or Quiz N–1 on this list for the topics covered in this quarter's  homework and lab assignments for the previous week. You should be well prepared if you come to class, come to section, do your assignments in
  a timely way, and ask questions where necessary.
As you use these quizzes to prepare, you should try to solve the problems yourself, and ask
in your lab section if you can't.  We have deliberately not displayed
answers here, to encourage you to do as we suggest.
