MR. KAY'S WILD RIDE
CASE STUDY PROGRAM

We will spend some time this quarter looking
at a program that simulates customers and rides at a theme park.  Eventually
we will have the following available:


A description of the problem


The Python source code





A simple, sample customers.txt
file; a longer file named customers2.txt;
a really long file named 1000customers.txt


A simple, sample rides.txt
file; a longer file named rides2.txt




This case study was designed by David G. Kay
and Ping Chen and implemented by Ping Chen in 2004 and 2005.  Gabriela Marcu
made many enhancements in 2005 and 2006. Alex Thorton made corrections in 2007. Joel Ross ported the code to Python in 2012.
