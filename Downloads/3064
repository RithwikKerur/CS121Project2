    				muvee: California culture in Singapore    			


muvee is a Singapore company that has done very well in automatic video editing area and has become a globally succeful product.Â  Its products are ‘wow’ inspiring.Â  I still remember when Pete and Terrance, the two cofounders, visited my house in San Diego before their product was launched and showed the product to me, I requested them to show it to my wife, daughter and son separately — and the reaction was consistent – Wow.
It was nice to visit them.Â  They are now about 90 people and just moved to a new location to accomodate consinued growth.Â  Their facility is very well planned — feels as if you are in California rather than in a Bank Building in Singapore.Â  Very interesting environment.
Dinner with Pete was great.Â  He is a true entrepreneur and a visionary.Â
