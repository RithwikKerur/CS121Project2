Welcome!
The Accessibility Research Collective brings together scholars and practitioners as a way of sharing our processes, plans, and thinking as they evolve alongside contemporary social issues related to computing, disability, and design. We are a multi-institutional group with affiliations at UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, Chapman University, and Northwestern University. We work in the fields of computing, design, and education and collaborate closely with community members through all phases of our work. Our efforts are informed by disability studies, critical theory, participatory design, action research, and more. We are committed to transforming research processes and practices to be more equitable and just. Our work is funded by the National Science Foundation, Toyota, Microsoft, and a UC Irvine Chancellor’s Inclusive Excellence Award.
