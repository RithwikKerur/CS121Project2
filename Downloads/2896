    				In Bali    			


I am a tourist in Bali.  Came here about 36 hour ago and will be here for 24 more.
Nice place, has natural beauty, people are friendly.
I was surprised to hear that 95% of the population here is Hindoo (yes this how they say ut).  Taxi driver explained to me four caste system in details as they follow it.  We (Sudha and I) went to some temples.  The most famous one — the Baisaki temple — is more than 1000 year old.  Definitely has many similarities with Indian temples.
This place reminds of India in many respects — from architecture and religion to shop styles and even monkeys.
