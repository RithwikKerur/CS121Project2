    				Election Fever    			


I have not seen the kind of election fever in USA in my 30 years in this country as I see this time.  It is exciting to see that people really care for this election.  For the first time so many people are voting.  
I had asked for mail ballot but by the time I got back from my trip there was no time to send the ballot.  So I filled it in and went to the polling station and just deposited it there.  The did save me about 45 minutes that I would stand in line.  But that also took away the fun of standing in line, chatting with people, and observing the social dynamics.
I will be teaching when the first results start coming.  So immediately after my class, I will rush home and sit infront of TV following the great victory — I do hope — of Obama.
