WICS Winter Quarter Week 2: Interview Prep Workshop 

 01/23/201901/28/2019admin



On January 16th, WICS hosted an Interview Prep Workshop in DBH 6011. There were about 40 students attending the event. Before the presentation, students were greeting each other, going over the questions that had been passed out, and eating pizza. WICS’ Internal Vice President Cheyenne Chavez and External Vice President Sharon Hsu introduced the workshop with a presentation on technical interviews, providing resources for practice and explaining the activity. Students then broke off into groups of four or five to work on the problem, discussing solutions to the easy, medium, and hard problems among themselves. Everyone had an hour to do two problems, and after the time was up, the solutions were presented. We hope everyone enjoyed the workshop! Good luck with interviews!
