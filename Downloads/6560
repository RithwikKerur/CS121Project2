applications to the fog or the cloud layer while ensuring the optimal response time for a ser-
vice. Traditional computation offloading policies assume the response time is only dominated by
the execution time. However, the response time is a function of many factors including contextual
parameters and application characteristics that can change over time. For the computation offloading
problem, the majority of existing literature presents efficient solutions considering a limited number of
parameters (e.g., computation capacity and network bandwidth) neglecting the effect of the application
characteristics and dataflow configuration. In this paper, we explore the impact of the computation
offloading on total application response time in three-layer IoT systems considering more realistic
parameters, e.g., application characteristics, system complexity, communication cost, and dataflow
configuration. This paper also highlights the impact of a new application characteristic parameter
defined as Output–Input Data Generation (OIDG) ratio and dataflow configuration on the system
behavior. In addition, we present a proof-of-concept end-to-end dynamic computation offloading

Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading.

While decoupled optimization of these processes yields local optima at each level, synergistic coupling of the system and data levels can lead to a holistic solution opening new opportunities for optimization. In this paper, we present an edge-assisted resource manager that dynamically controls the delity and duration of sensing w.r.t. changes in the patient's activity and health state, thus ne-tuning the trade-o between energy-e ciency and measurement accuracy. The cornerstone of our proposed solution is an intelligent low-latency real-time controller implemented at the edge layer that detects abnormalities in the patient's condition and accordingly adjusts the sensing parameters of a recon gurable wireless sensor node. We assess the e ciency of our proposed system via a case study of PPG-based medical Early Warning Score (EWS) system. Our experiments on a real full hardware-software EWS system reveal up to 49% power savings while maintaining the accuracy of the sensory data.},
