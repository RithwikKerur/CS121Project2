WICS Winter Quarter Week 9: Self-Care Session 

 03/08/201903/13/2019admin



On March 6, 2019, WICS hosted a Self-Care Session, with fun and de-stressing activities for all the members and the students that attended. We included several stress-relieving activities assigned to each table, and there were fun songs and videos played in the beginning to create a stress-free mood. The main activities included coloring, puzzle-solving, and writing “warm and fuzzies”. The coloring was done with markers and was a very good way of de-stressing. People also had fun and challenged their minds with the large 500 piece puzzle, finishing it at the end. Finally, the warm and fuzzies were distributed to the members and attendants for their presence and companionship. Overall, the event was very relaxing, and the WICS members and students got a well-deserved break before finals!
