ICS Alumni Hall of Fame

The ICS Alumni Hall of Fame honors those who have made a significant impact in their profession, or in other ways have brought distinction to their alma mater. Every fall, we seek nominations for exceptional alumni and then hold a special celebration for new and past Hall of Fame inductees during the following winter.
The deadline to submit a nomination for the 2019 Hall of Fame is Dec. 13, 2018.
