About
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia in 2013, where I studied under the 
mentorship of Kevin Sullivan. Since my graduation, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher 
with Sam Malek of  University of California, Irvine. 

I have also visited CSAIL MIT as a postdoctoral research fellow working with Daniel Jackson. 
I am broadly interested in software engineering, and 
particularly in advancing software reliability by 
developing new methods and tools relying on concepts from fields like 
lightweight formal methods, software synthesis, software testing, model-driven 
development, and software architecture.
