Course Notes in development
Also, a possibly helpful LaTeX template I use for homeworks and solutions.
(Or, this link has another nice way to include Matlab code in LaTeX.)

Introduction to machine learning and data mining
How can a machine learn from experience, to become better at a given task?  How can we automatically extract knowledge or make sense of massive quantities of data?  These are the fundamental questions of machine learning.  Machine learning and data mining algorithms use techniques from statistics, optimization, and computer science to create automated systems which can sift through large volumes of data at high speed to make predictions or decisions without human intervention.

Machine learning as a field is now incredibly pervasive, with applications from the web (search, advertisements, and suggestions) to national security, from analyzing biochemical interactions to traffic and emissions to astrophysics.  Perhaps most famously, the $1M Netflix prize stirred up interest in learning algorithms in professionals, students, and hobbyists alike.

This class will familiarize you with a broad cross-section of models and algorithms for machine learning, and prepare you for research or industry application of machine learning techniques. 

Background
We will assume basic familiarity with the concepts of probability and linear algebra.  Some programming will be required; we will primarily use Matlab, but no prior experience with Matlab will be assumed.  (Most or all code should be Octave compatible, so you may use Octave if you prefer.)

Textbook and Reading
There is no required textbook for the class.  However, useful books on the subject for supplementary reading include
Murphy's "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective", Duda, Hart & Stork, "Pattern Classification", and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, "The Elements of Statistical Learning".

Piazza
I use Piazza to manage student discussions and questions.  Our class link is:
http://piazza.com/uci/winter2014/cs178.

Matlab
Often we will write code for the course using the Matlab environment.  Matlab is accessible through NACS computers at several campus locations (e.g., 
MSTB-A, 
MSTB-B,
and the ICS lab), and if you want a copy for yourself student licenses are fairly inexpensive ($100).  If you use Octave, please be careful to use Matlab-compatible syntax (not Octave extensions), since otherwise I or the TA may be unable to interpret your code.  

If you are not familiar with Matlab, there are a number of tutorials on the web:
University of Utah, very short
CMU / UMichigan tutorial, also short
University of Florida's tutorial, more complete
Union College / Cyclismo.Org tutorial, also good
UMaryland guide, lots of pointers to other tutorials and reference manuals
You may want to start with one of the very short tutorials, then use the longer ones as a reference during the rest of the term.
