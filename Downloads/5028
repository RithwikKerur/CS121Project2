WICS Mentorship Program 

 10/17/201209/06/2013admin














We had a fantastic turnout for our Mentorship Program.  We printed out 35 mentee mixer sheets and we ran out!  We had a mixer and ‘speeddating’ event so our mentors and mentees could get acquainted and find out who they best got along with.  We’re looking forward to hearing more how our mentors and mentees are doing later in the quarter!
