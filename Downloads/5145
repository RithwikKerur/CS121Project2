Fall 2021 Week 2: Stripe Info Session 

 10/14/202110/14/2021admin



This Wednesday, October 6th, WICS collaborated with other UCI campus organizations such as SWE, NSBE, and SHPE to host the Stripe Company Info Session. The meeting began with club introductions and some fun ice breaker questions. Afterwards, we were able to meet Richard Noguchi from Stripe and his other team members. We completed some rapid fire questions to learn more about Stripe such as what their numbers represented. The meeting ended with a Q&A Panel from the Stripe representatives and some exciting prizes! Thank you Stripe for joining us today!
