Dan Gardner is an Informatics PhD Candidate at UCI. His Masters is in Medicine, Science and Technology Studies from the Department of Anthropology at UCI. Broadly, he is concerned with examining the ways that cultural values and systems of authority can materialize in the design of digital media and games. Specifically, he looks at the systems that support and surround games, but influence them in often powerful ways, or govern access to them. This can include character selection or creation systems, the design of controllers, authentication and distribution systems, and more. His research helps to illustrate the values and power structures that pervade our systems of digital media.Publications:2018. “Dynamic Demographics: Lessons from a Large-Scale Census of Performative Possibilities in Games” CHI’18. 2017. “Teaching Pervasive Game Design in a Zombie Apocalypse” CHI PLAY’17 Extended Abstracts, Spotlight Series.2017. “Chalk, Props, and Costumes: Two Exercises for Teaching Pervasive Game Design” In Analog Game Studies2017. “Chat Speed OP [Pogchamp]: Practices of Coherence in Massive Chats” CHI’172016. “Gatekeeping Games: A Topographic Consideration of Paraludic Borderlands.” DiGRA/FDG  2015. “I See My Representation and I Will Raise You, Identification” (Book Review) The Geek Anthropologist. web.
