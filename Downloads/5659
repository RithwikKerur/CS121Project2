Computer Game Science
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your studies?
I had a very hard time deciding, but ultimately, I chose UCI because it had the major I was interested in and I liked how the school felt when I visited.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
I enjoyed learning about the vast culture of video games – I didn’t really know much about it before, because I didn’t have my own laptop or computer to play on and I haven’t had much money for console games (I just discovered Shadow of the Colossus last year!). I also enjoyed my classes in the HCI track. Design is something that most people don’t seem to think about, and it’s easy to criticize it for being lazy or unintuitive. The process is fascinating.
Have you done an internship?
Yes. My IT internship at Microsemi that started in the summer has been extended, so I’m still doing one! I’m looking forward to having more responsibilities and making myself useful.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
Do you mean things like hanging out with friends? If so, then yes! But if you mean clubs or sororities, I can’t really fit them into my schedule, since I live quite far from campus. However, before I learned that most clubs have meetings at 7:00, I signed up for 3 clubs during Welcome Week so there’s definitely not a lack of interest!
What are you most proud of so far?
That I came a centimeter or two out of my shell. It’s easy for me to be comfortable with a small group of friends, but every time I move and am forced to get to know new people, I can feel it getting easier. I still have a long way to go, though! UCI is a great place to become more social; it feels like you can just start a conversation with any person you pass by.
What has been the best part of your experience?
Other than the classes and topics I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed doing research on League of Legends under Professor Nardi for my ICSHP paper. She was able to meet with me every couple of weeks and she taught me how to approach and analyze what I’d gotten from interviews and a survey I conducted.
What are your aspirations?
I don’t have very specific aspirations – after I graduate, I just want to be working on a game or something related to games or designing something.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
As a mega-commuter, I would definitely advise other commuters (and even non-commuters) to manage their time wisely! It feels trite to write it here, but it’s so important. We may not have a strict schedule to follow or 6 hours of class every day like we did in all our previous years of schooling, but that doesn’t mean we should spend less time on school. As others have mentioned, the first year is tough, especially if you’re learning programming concepts for the first time (like me). Things get a lot easier in your upper-div classes once you’ve got a good foundation. Another big thing is to attend the Career Fairs, and make use of the Career Center. I was able to go to a job shadowing and got my current internship by doing that!
