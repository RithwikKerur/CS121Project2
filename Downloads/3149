    				We have a long way to go!    			


Just read this in Times of India.  India is the most illiterate county and has poor record in human development index.  When we read all the good things, we should not forget such important things.  We have a lng way to go in every area.  We just tend to focus on absolute numbers and usually forget that our size is not a single digit Millions, but single digit Billions.

Hello,
No doubt that “India is the most illiterate county” but we should not forget that People say India is also a developing country.  So, we should have patience and we all should be together and help in the progress of the country.  We have a long way to go! Great!
