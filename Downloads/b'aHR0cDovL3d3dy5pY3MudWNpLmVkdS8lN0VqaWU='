From September 1999 to January 2006, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Informatics of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. My research area was Software. My advisor is Richard N. Taylor. I was also affiliated with Institute for Software Research.

Before coming to UCI, I studied software engineering at Software Engineering Lab of Fudan University and worked there as a lecturer. 
After graduating from UCI, I started working for Google at its Santa Monica office. 
My resume is here. My curriculum vitae is here.
