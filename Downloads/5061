WICS Spring Quarter Week 4: Battle of the Mentorships 

 05/03/201905/03/2019admin



On April 22, WICS had our second Battle of the Mentorships for our 2018-2019 Mentorship program! Thirty mentors and mentees enjoyed refreshments before preparing to battle in a series of competitions. Our Vice Presidents Cheyenne Chavez and Sharon Hsu instructed the teams through a total of 7 games including: human knot, passing through a hula hoop, a swag-filled relay race, musical chairs (to the tune of the pokemon theme song ðŸ˜‰), stacked fidget spinning, waterless water pong, and cup stacking. Although every team put on a good fight, at the end of the night Normal team was crowned the strongest family. Following Normal was team Steel and team Bug. Congratulations to our mentorship champs!
