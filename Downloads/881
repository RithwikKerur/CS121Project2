Ruberg has article featured in new Gaming Representation book
August 3, 2017


Assistant Professor of Informatics Bonnie Ruberg’s article, “Playing to Lose: The Queer Art of Failing at Video Games,” was included as a chapter in a new book titled Gaming Representation: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Video Games, which was published on July 3, 2017 by Indiana University Press. Gaming Representation examines the portrayals of race, gender and sexuality in a range of video games from casual to indie to mainstream. In their essays, the contributors to this volume argue that representation and identity function as systems in games that share a strong connection to code and platforms. The book was edited by Jennifer Malkowski, assistant professor of film and media studies at Smith College, and TreaAndrea M. Russworm, associate professor of English at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.

Ruberg joined the UCI faculty in 2016 while completing her postdoc at the University of Southern California. She earned her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 2015. Ruberg will be teaching her first UCI courses this fall that include an undergraduate lecture in game studies and a Ph.D. graduate seminar called, “Technology, Sexuality, and Gender.” She is also the co-editor of the volume Queer Game Studies and the lead organizer of the annual Queerness and Games Conference.
