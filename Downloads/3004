    				Progress in Immersive Sports    			


NBA is taking an important step in immersive sports at this year’s all star games.Â  See the story at News.com.

The games and exhibition events will be shot with an array of five, double-lensed cameras developed by Pace Technologies, a company founded by Titanic movie director James Cameron and camera designer Vince Pace. Cameron is now shooting Avatar, his next film, in 3D using the Pace Fusion camera.
Sony stacked two of its digital 4K projectors to bring the 3D images to two, 40-foot silver screens provided by Real D, whose 3D projection system is the most widely used in U.S. theaters for screening 3D films.
Attendees will wear modern polarized glasses that enable them to see a 3D image. The cameras will be virtually stationary to avoid overwhelming viewers’ senses, and audio will come from courtside instead of the announcers’ booth.
