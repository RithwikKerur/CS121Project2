Mic: “How can Blizzard stop harassment in ‘Overwatch’? The answer is complicated” (Katherine Lo quoted)

March 2, 2017


As you might imagine, the issue is complicated. We spoke with Kat Lo — A Ph.D. student and researcher in online communities and harassment at University of California, Irvine — via Skype to help us understand exactly why online harassment is such a tough thing to snuff out. Lo has consulted gaming and tech companies about mitigating harassment and has spent eight years moderating online communities, so she knows firsthand how complicated the situation is.

February 28, 2017


“It’s perhaps unrealistic in the short term to think we can change gaming culture,” Lo said. “But we can create these spaces where people feel safe and feel like they have a community.”

BizTech: “Want to Improve Employee Productivity? Wearables Could Be the Answer” (Mark cited)

February 13, 2017


One popular way for businesses to implement the quantified workplace is through corporate wellness programs that outfit workers with fitness trackers, measuring the distance they walk each day.
The goal is to promote exercise. Healthier employees means less absenteeism and improved productivity, explains Gloria Mark, an informatics professor at University of California, Irvine.

UCI eSports: “Women in Gaming at UCI”

February 10, 2017


In the field of gaming, it is believed that the number of male players overshadow the number of female players. However, such an ideology has proven to be false as the population of male and female players are, in fact, quite balanced. Thus, the question is raised – if the numbers are equal, why do women continue to be excluded from competitive spaces and how do we increase the involvement of women in the video game industry?
Held at UCI on February 2nd in association with the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, UCI eSports, and Women’s Empowerment Initiative, the Women in Gaming Panel discussed the influence of the representation of women in gaming and the concept of inclusive gaming.
