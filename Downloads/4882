Board Game Night 

 06/15/2015Ivan Law



Even though it’s already week 6, midterm season continued. Rather than bombarding the members with information, WICS decided to host a board game night to allow members to socialize and relax. About 15 people showed up and relaxed while chatting with other members and playing board games like Apples to Apples, Werewolf, and Taboo.
