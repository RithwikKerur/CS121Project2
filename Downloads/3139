    				Bai is no more with us    			


Today morning around 10 AM — India time late evening — Sudha’s mother left this world.  When the ventilator was removed, she could not survive and left.
That means Sudha’s previos generation is gone.  For me my mother is there.  But she is also very old and will be definitely shocked and affected by Bai’s going — they have been close friends for long time.
One one hand it is shocking and very sad, but it is good that her suffering did not continue.  She was a great person and had good life.  She helped so many people including those that even kind hearted people will not help.
I am proud to be part of her life.  I am thanksful to her for giving so much in my life.
