    				Riya —  computer vision in search    			


A video interview and demo of riya.com from Demo2006 shows how computer vision technology is being applied in search and management of your pictures.  I know that many of my computer vision people will find it inspiring that a company is being built on what they do routinely.  But that is what is called entrepreneursip and is different from just research.
Anybody wants to extend functionality of riya.com — I am sure many of my friends in computer vision community think that they can do much better than riya.com in tagging pictures.  So — here is a chance for you and an inspiration for you to be innovative in applying your technology.  🙂
