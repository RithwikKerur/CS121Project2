The Problems with Being Virtual


Virtual Communities


"Virtual" == "Not"?
    
"Virtual" == "Cyberspace" (another loathsome term)
    A community that depends upon cyberspace for interaction
    

What, then, is a Community?
    
Webster has 12 definitions, all poor
    My definition:
A group of organisms bound together by enlightened self-interest
           and characterized by a common product


Virtual Communities
    
A newsgroup is not, in and of itself, a virtual community
    The Internet Community (R.I.P.)
    The Apache Group
    


What is Apache?

Apache Group

Formed in February `95
8 Founding Members (all end-users)


Common Goal

To provide a public, secure, efficient and extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the standards.


Current Status

#1 Server
    (46% market share / 517,000 sites)
~12 active developers (5 of the founders)
Hundreds of contributors

Development Context

Multinational

USA, UK, Canada, Italy, The Netherlands, ...


All Volunteer

Everybody has (at least) one other real job


Differing subgoals

Enlightened Self-interest


No CEO, President, Manager, or even Secretary

Coordination tasks are voluntary
Volunteers get tired/busy, rotate tasks
Decisions made by consensus, voting
36 hours to make a serious decision


Secrets of Our Success

User-driven Development

The End-Users are the Developers
Core developers act as Quality Control
System designed for Extensibility (API, source code)


Rapid Response to User Needs

Public support line (newsgroup, bugdb)
Problem -> Patch, typically less than a week
Web-based Distributions


Blistering Production of New Features

Unlimited supply of ideas (good and bad)


Collaborative Development
Requires:

Warm Bodies

At least one common goal
   
but not all goals are held in common
   

Communication
   
Public:  one to all, recorded for later review
   Private: one to few
   

Shared Information Space
   
Access to past communication
   Access to past and current development products
   

Coordination
   
to make all of the above possible
   


Impact of the Internet on Collaboration

Millions of Warm Bodies to choose from!

Many goals held in common
   
Easy to find people when working on a global scale
   

E-mail for Communication
   
Public: mailing list, archived in Hypermail
   Private: off-list mail
   

The Web is a Shared Information Space
   
Access to past communication
   Access to past and current development products
   

Coordination
   
... oops, still a work in progress
   


Collaboration within the Apache Group

E-mail Communication
   
Developer mailing list (avg. 50 msgs/day)
   Private mail among core developers
   

Shared Information Space
   
Machine in Bay Area
      
FTP, HTTP, and remote CVS servers
      Logins for core developers
      
Public area for distributions,
       Developer area for work-in-progress
   

Coordination
   
Voting (on 
       patches, releases, strategy, etc.)
   Agenda



Process Evolution

1995 Feb
Patches exchanged by mail, given a name,
    vote tabulated (+1 yes, -1 veto, +0 abstain)
    patches applied,
    generate new release
1995 Mar
Formal patch
        database/forms tried, later replaced by simple directory
1995 Sep
Voting guidelines
        codified,
    separate roles of voter, vote coordinator, release builder
1996 Jan
Remote CVS enabled
1996 Nov
GNATS problem tracking
        system
1997 Jan
Voting restored
    Agenda created


The Problems with Being Virtual

Limited Support for Coordination

Keeping track of progress and potential conflict has required a
    deluge of communication (e-mail)
Maintaining the Agenda is a manual process


Entry Barriers

Difficult to browse the current software state
Difficult to separate areas of development


Apache succeeds in large part due to the unusual expertise of its
    user/developers
   
all Internet experts
   capable of compiling, installing software
   

E-mail is not sufficient for resolving interpersonal conflicts
    that are more than just "differences in opinion"


The first three problems can be reduced by better tools, but the latter
requires some form of synchronous, voice communication, preferably on a
regular basis.
