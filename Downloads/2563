    				First morning of Where 2.0    			


The first half day of Where 2.0 conference has been very interesting.  Mapping seems to be really taking off.  Many applications are being designed and the interfaces that Google and MSN showed are really taking us closer to experiential interfaces.  Very good.
Another important message that is definitely coming strongly is that data is being collected about many different things related to spatial attributes and then this data is being presented in spatially indexed form.  This is a major change and is likely to change the way things are done.  First time I see real world coming close to cyber techniques.  The only important missing thing so far has been the role of time.  It has come up but only indirectly.  Well in my talk I will emphasize that this afternoon.
