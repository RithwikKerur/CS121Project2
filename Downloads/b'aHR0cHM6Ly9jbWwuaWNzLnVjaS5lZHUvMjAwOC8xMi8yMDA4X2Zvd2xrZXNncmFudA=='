Center Member Awarded Grant to Study Vision Techniques for Satellite Imagery Standard

December 1, 2008
News



Charless Fowlkes, an assistant professor in computer science, was recently awarded a grant through the UC Lab Research program, entitled "Context Driven Image Interpretation in Satellite Imagery".  The grant provides $488k over three years and is a collaboration between Fowlkes and investigators at Los Alamos National Labs.  Their goal is to develop new techniques for image segmentation and object recognition based on contextual relations within a scene. These methods will be applied to performing large-scale visual search and automatic identification of potential threats in satellite imagery, in order to aid nuclear verification and counter proliferation efforts.
