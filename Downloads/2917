    				A really important video news:  IEEE.TV    			


Though everybody is talking about Google acquisition of Youtube, I decided to post an item that I find more interesting in the realm of video.Â  IEEE announced launch of IEEE.TV.Â  As described:
After more than 100 years of publishing magazines, the IEEE might think broadcasting is outside its scope. Studios, lights, cameras, microphonesâ€”the complexity of it all seemed too daunting to consider seriously. But IEEE felt it had a role to play and released its Internet broadcasting network in August.

â€œIEEE.tv is intended to make broadcasting a vibrant and valuable component of the IEEE memberâ€™s experience,â€? says Pedro Ray, vice president of IEEE Regional Activities, the area that oversees the station. â€œAnd it will advance the IEEEâ€™s commitment to educating the public on important technology and engineering issues.â€?


IEEE.tv features original content, with broadcasts that include coverage of IEEE conferences, interviews with IEEE book authors, primers on technology-related careers, and overviews of IEEE products and services. The prerecorded programs run anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes; it is expected that most programs will be 15 minutes or less. 
This is important because it shows that even the publishers of Â highly abstract and technical material are adopting video format for their future.Â  This is big.Â  This shows that video is becoming a maintstream medium for communication of knowledge.Â
