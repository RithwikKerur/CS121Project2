VentureBeat: “How the ESA’s acting CEO views video game addiction” (Constance Steinkuehler mentioned)

February 22, 2019


“At the federal level there is a lot of interest in the power of games. You have, for example, the Department of Education that funds game research and how to use games in educational ways. Past administrations have actually had a video game guild, where they talk about games. Obviously there was Constance Steinkuehler, who’s a professor at UC-Irvine now. She spent time at the White House promoting the value of games in learning. There is a lot of interest in the power of games.”

Graduate Student Spotlight: Hillary Abraham Driven to Explore Future Transportation





A recent Marketplace article, “Your Car Is Not Self-Driving, No Matter How Much It Seems Like It Is,” quotes informatics Ph.D. student Hillary Abraham in response to concerns from safety advocates that driver-support technologies will be viewed as self-driving. “If that’s the attitude, then it’s only a matter of time until you get in an accident,” she explains. The article reports on a study Abraham conducted while working as a research assistant at MIT’s AgeLab. She found that car dealerships don’t always sufficiently explain to customers how advanced safety features work. Now at UCI, Abraham is exploring broader questions about the future of transportation from a variety of perspectives.

EdSurge: “Playing Games Can Build 21st-Century Skills. Research Explains How.” (Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Kurt Squire quoted)

February 13, 2019


“In the moment they’re talking about it, you get a lot of learning for free because they might have to think about technical terminology,” says Kurt Squire, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has studied how games impact learning. “That’s a general finding in research in other fields, but it works in kind of a cool way in games.”

Professor Bowker’s Research as a CAS Fellow Tackles Timely Issues

February 11, 2019


The Centre for Advanced Study (CAS) in Oslo, Norway has brought together a group of Fellows to collaborate on a novel project, “In Sync: How Synchronisation and Mediation Produce Collective Times, Then and Now.” As explained in the project abstract:
Synchronised collective actions and experiences include political elections, sports events, demonstrations, parades, as well as other public rituals or performances…. But these synchronised collective times do not exist in and by themselves. They are always the result of work, and this work crucially involves and employs a wide range of communicative genres carried by different media.

The New York Times: “Our Brains Aren’t Designed to Handle the Trump Era” (Gloria Mark cited)




In 2016, before Trump was elected, Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, examined the daily habits of 40 information workers. She discovered they checked their email 77 times per day, on average, and slalomed between screens every 47 seconds. … For what it’s worth, Gloria Mark says that women, in her research, tend to self-interrupt less frequently than men.
