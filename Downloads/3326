    				USA has become General Motors    			


Thomas Friedman’s piece in NYT is once again a pointed observation on how things are.  It sums it up very nicely in the following:
To top it off, weâ€™ve fallen into a trend of diverting and rewarding the best of our collective I.Q. to people doing financial engineering rather than real engineering. These rocket scientists and engineers were designing complex financial instruments to make money out of money â€” rather than designing cars, phones, computers, teaching tools, Internet programs and medical equipment that could improve the lives and productivity of millions.
For all these reasons, our present crisis is not just a financial meltdown crying out for a cash injection. We are in much deeper trouble. In fact, we as a country have become General Motors â€” as a result of our national drift. Look in the mirror: G.M. is us.
He concludes by saying:
John Kennedy led us on a journey to discover the moon. Obama needs to lead us on a journey to rediscover, rebuild and reinvent our own backyard.
How true!!!
