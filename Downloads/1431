Faculty profile




Lubomir  BicProfessor EmeritusDEGREE:Ph.D. 1979, UC IrvineRESEARCH AREAS: Networks and Distributed SystemsRESEARCH INTERESTS: Dr. Bic's current project, called Messengers, focuses on developing a new programming paradigm for distributed systems based on the principle of autonomous messages. A Messenger carries its own behavior as it propagates through a network of interpreter nodes. At each node, a Messenger can perform arbitrary computations, hence the collection of Messengers comprising an application may be viewed as a coordination layer, which triggers the execution of node-resident programs and carries data.
