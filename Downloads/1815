A WikiPage is simply the basic building block of a WikiWikiWeb that contains text and images. See WikiStructures and WikiWikiWeb for more information.

Wiki pages can have an edit template to predefine initial content, see Cookbook:Edit Templates 

Wiki pages are stored in individual flat files, see Page File Format and Flat File Advantages.





This page may have  a more recent version on pmwiki.org: PmWiki:WikiPage, and  a talk page: PmWiki:WikiPage-Talk.
