    				Test Driving SEraja — the EventWeb    			


If you are interested in test driving EventWeb, please visit
www.seraja.com
and send a request.  SEraja is going to start their prebeta version beginning March 15th and is planning to invite around 300 people to play with their system to see what an EventWeb is and how it can complement DocumentWeb and help you in finding more and deep information related to events.  It will also allow you to make events that you consider important as the part of the Web.  So you could be creating nodes that will be important events rather than just web pages.
(Disclosure:  I am a co-founder of SEraja.)
