Graph-Constrained Correlation Dynamics







        Graph-Constrained Correlation Dynamics
      

        Graph-Constrained Correlation Dynamics allows the specification of
        models that describe probability
        distributions which evolve continuously in time according to the
        chemical master equation. 
        This is accomplished by  combining a
        Markov Random Field, which represents the instantaneous
        probability of the system, with a set 
        of ordinary differential equations on the parameters of the MRF.
        
	

        
        GCCDdd is an implementation of GCCD
	within the Mathematica  
        programming language, available 
	here. This package also includes
        two example GCCD models. 
        GCCDdd is offered with the
	GNU Public License; essentially you are free to create
	derivative works, as long as they too carry a license as open
	as the GPL. 

	


        In order to use GCCDdd, you will need the Depenency Diagrams
	package, which is available here. 
	
        


	Additionally, the GCCD package implements
        an alternative learning algorithm for GCCD. This method is based
	on fitting parameters for the time-derivates of MRF parameters 
        using the lasso.
