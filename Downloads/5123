Adobe Info Session 

 02/03/2015Ivan Law



On January 21, WICS hosted an Adobe Info Session. The first hour consisted of a mixer where members that RSVP’d could talk face to face with the female engineers of Adobe (and eat great food). Only 50 spots were allocated for this mixer, and they all filled up instantly. The members asked all sorts of questions from daily life to information about internships. The second hour was an info session that was open to all. Where Adobe talked about what they’re looking for and internships opportunities. Make sure to check out our future info sessions!
