Testimonials

The Center for Statistical Consulting has delivered high-quality and thorough work on several occasions, capably deploying several inter-rater reliability measures and effect-size analysis for stratified and randomized sample sets. I highly recommend them as they are welcoming of researchers from across the disciplines.Bradley Queen, Ph.D., Associate Teaching Professor of English, UCI School of Humanities

I ran an entire phase 2 multisite randomized clinical trial through the Center for Statistical Consulting. They were available, and the work was consistently excellent. I would recommend their services without hesitation.Steven C. Cramer, M.D., Professor of Neurology, UCI School of Medicine

Dr. Ricks-Oddie was very helpful to me during preparation of my DOD grant that included mouse tumor studies. Reviewers are particularly concerned that the sample size will be sufficient to answer the experimental question being addressed, and professional help with an accurate power analysis was very valuable. While we rely on GraphPad Prism to help us through the statistical analysis of our data, the opportunity to go through our analysis with a trained statistician to confirm that we are making appropriate assumptions and conclusions will further increase the rigor and quality of our science.Aimee Edinger, VMD/Ph.D., Associate Professor of  Developmental & Cell Biology, UCI School of Biological Sciences
