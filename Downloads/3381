    				Progress in mKrishi project    			


Yesterday I got a chance to visit the mKrishi project team in Thane office of TCS (Tata Consul ting Services).  I got involved in this project some time  ago, but yesterday was the first time to meet the team face-to-face and see demos.  
I believe that this project is going to be revolutionary in its impact. (Disclosure: I am working with this project.)  I will report more details of this soon.
