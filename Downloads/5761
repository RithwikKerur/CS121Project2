The New York Times: “Do Chance Meetings at the Office Boost Innovation? There’s No Evidence of It.” (Judith Olson quoted)




At the same time, technology — like Zoom, Slack and Google Docs — has made idea generation as effective online, researchers said. Judith Olson, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Irvine, has studied the effect of distance on teamwork for three decades. Distance matters much less now, she said: “Because of the technology these days, we’re actually inching closer and closer to replicating the office.”

Capstone Program Showcases Growing Talent of ICS Students

June 22, 2021


The first incarnation of the capstone course in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) was in 2009, with 19 students from the Department of Informatics working on five project teams. Now, more than a decade later, the Informatics capstone course is offered three times a year, and ICS has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors. It also offers capstone courses through its Master of Human-Computer Interaction and Design (MHCID), Master of Computer Science (MCS) and Master of Software Engineering (MSWE) professional programs. Even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year, more than 130 ICS capstone projects were successfully completed.

UCI News: “Beyond Zoom: Virtual reality classrooms” (Crista Lopes quoted)

June 15, 2021


Cristina Lopes, UCI Chancellor’s Professor of informatics, sits in a courtyard waiting as her students slowly trickle into class. In front of them is a series of large objects: the topic of today’s lecture. Lopes reaches out and touches a yellow cylinder floating in front of her, and the object is instantly replaced with a complex line of code.
This classroom is not outside in the courtyard or a park. It’s not even on campus. Lopes’ classroom exists entirely in cyberspace, created via a program she helped design called OpenSimulator.

CNN Business: “‘It’s just human dignity.’ Trans writers and journalists struggle to get old bylines corrected” (Theresa Tanenbaum mentioned)

June 1, 2021


In the fight for what she wants, Tanenbaum is, in her own words, willing to make a nuisance of herself. She began speaking out, working with others who also support name-change policies in academic publishing, and connecting directly with publishers. And she’s starting to see changes, as a slew of major academic publishers have since enacted policies allowing anyone to quietly, retroactively change the name on their published work.

UCI News: #IamUCI profile of Mayara Costa Figueiredo, Informatics Ph.D. ’21

May 28, 2021


If you’ve ever used a health app to track your menstrual cycle or count steps, you’ll want to follow Mayara Costa Figueiredo’s research. According to a recent Gallup survey, 20 percent of U.S. adults employ health apps, with high-income households, women and young adults among the most enthusiastic users. An interest in the intersection of health informatics and human-computer interaction led Figueiredo from her native Brazil to UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences, where she works under the supervision of Associate Professor Yunan Chen and Professor Kai Zheng in the Health and Informatics Lab.

CNN: “These companies were hybrid before the pandemic. Here’s how they make it work” (Judith Olson quoted)

May 21, 2021


“There are some real difficulties when some people are remote and everybody else is in person. You forget about that [remote] person, you don’t know what they are doing, you don’t think to talk to them because it takes extra effort,” said Judith Olson, professor of informatics at the University of California Irvine.
