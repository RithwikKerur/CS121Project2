    				eventful.com    			


WWW.evdb.com has now become eventful.com.  The site is looking good.  It has better interface and addition of new features like recently added events and recently viewed events is an interesting change.  I always liked the focus of this site on events.  As far as I know this is the site that really focuses on events and their venues and times.
