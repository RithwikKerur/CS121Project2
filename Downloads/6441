Eighth Homework






ICS H21 • UC IRVINE • DAVID G. KAY • FALL 2009
Eighth Homework 
 Complete this assignment by the start of lab on
  Monday, November 16.
(1) Chapter 30 of HtDP introduces
accumulators; Chapter 31 continues the topic.  Being able to rewrite a function
using an accumulator can give you significantly better performance, so it's
a technique worth mastering.  Chapter 32 gives three longer examples. Do exercises 30.1.1 and 30.1.2.
 (2) We're not doing Intermezzo
  6 (Chapter 33).  You'll see this material in ICS 51.
 (3) We have posted some code to implement parts of an iTunes-like system. Look it over in preparation for the next lab. There's nothing to turn in for this part.


Based in part on ICS H21assignments by David
G. Kay from Fall 2001; modified by David G. Kay, Fall 2004, Fall 2005, Fall 2008, Fall 2009.
