Computer Game Science
Why did you choose UCI for your studies?
I wanted to go to school for something having to do with game programming or design, but wasn’t sure what schools offered reputable majors in these fields. UC Irvine got on my radar when I heard that they were offering a new Computer Game Science major, and knowing that they were already one of the best Computer Science colleges I knew that their new major had some promise. Plus, after falling in love with the campus and realizing how many professional game companies are nearby I was sold.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
There are a lot of programming classes that need to be taken to be able to create a game, and that can be a lot of hard work. But once I reached that point where I could make games and experiment and bring my creations to life, it all came together to make me realize that I made the right choice. And the best part of all of that is watching people play your game and enjoy what you created.
Have you done an internship?
Yes, I got accepted for a Quality Assurance Tester internship at Obsidian Entertainment during the summer of 2014 that ended up turning into a part-time job once school resumed. They seem to like the work I’ve done and want to keep me around, so I may have a full-time position waiting for me once I graduate as well.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
My first two years at UCI I participated in the Video Game Development Club where I worked with other students to create games outside of classes. It was a big commitment, but the experience from working on games, having deadlines, making things presentable, and all of the professional speakers that would give talks was pivotal to my growth. After those first two years, I became so involved that I ended up becoming the president of the VGDC for my third year. That added a lot of responsibilities, but gave me even more insight into what it takes to create games and what is necessary to get people excited about the development of games.
What are you most proud of so far?
In one of the courses I took my first year our final project was to create a game in Unity in 4 weeks in small groups. I teamed up with four people that would grow to become some of my best friends, and we created a horror game based in an asylum where the creatures would follow you and attack only when you looked away from them. It took a lot of long nights to get the core features we wanted and it took even longer to get the game to invoke the right kind of feeling, but in the end all of our hard work paid off. When all of the teams presented their games, everybody voted for their favorites and our team won Player’s Choice. On top of that, we made our TA literally fall out of her chair on multiple occasions while playing our game, so that was a plus.
What has been the best part of your experience?
I’ve made some amazing friends while at school here. The classes I’ve taken and the clubs and events I’ve been a part of have started priceless relationships with people that I have a lot in common with. The people I’ve met have also introduced me to new things I never would have discovered otherwise, and have been key to me getting my job in the gaming industry. I don’t know where I would be without the people I’ve met, but I know I wouldn’t be nearly as happy.
What are your aspirations?
I want to change my role at Obsidian from a QA Tester to a designer. I love the systems that make games work and how they all have to mesh together and compliment each other in a balance, and I also love designing areas to mold the user’s experience, so either a system designer or area designer would be my ideal positions to move towards. My time at Obsidian has been amazing, so I hope to move forward and continue working on great games there.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
You need to be open to new experiences. Seek out and learn new programming languages and game engines, join clubs that excite you, and don’t be afraid to try something that you never thought you would. At the worst you learn some new things, and at the best you might just discover something that you’ll enjoy for the rest of your life.
