    				SEraja    			


Webyantra has a coverage of SEraja — I agree that in the current stage of the development — a very early stage —
I think this is a very well conceptualized product and it addresses a very basic human need. However, I spent quite some time going through the website and in my opinion, some of the communication about the product and how it works, needs to be explained better.
The team is working hard on this.
