    				“What’s here?” on Google Maps    			


Google maps have introducesd a nice feature on their maps.  You can rightclick at any point and then select ‘What’s here?’ to get information at that point.  This feature uses the resolution of the map that you are viewing.  As their blog says:
This feature takes into account the zoom level you’re looking at, and gives you the most appropriate geographical entity at that point.
I found names or restaurants in a bldg to just lat-long in the middle of the ocean.
This combined with the gps systems becoming available on many devices, will make location of events very easy and possible.  I see many interesting possibilities using this feature for creating EventWeb.
