    				Back Home    			


Finally I am back home after one month in India and Singapore.  The trip was good and productive.  I also had one week of vacation with family.
But it is good to be back home and get into regular things.  Unfortunately, there is a pile of things waiting here tha will take a few days to clear.
Two important observations for me in this trip were things that are happening in India and in Singapore.
It is impressive to see how vibrant is India currently.  Clearly, things are happening there and it is a good time for anybody who wants to do things in India.  Clearly there are infrastructure problems, but there are so many positive things and since India is starting from such a low financial base, there is lot to be done.  So this is likely to continue for quite some time.  
Singapore’s emphasis on Media is interesting to me.
