WICS Spring Quarter Week 8: WICS Game Night 

 06/03/201908/21/2019admin



On Monday, May 20th, WICS hosted a Game Night, where there were several games and activities that people could play and bond over. The games included online trivia games, card games, and role-play games. All of them required strategy and thinking, but were also very relaxing for the people and were able to give them a fun way to channel their minds. We all had a lot of fun and were able to become closer to others and meet more people, which was one of the biggest goals of the evening.
