    				Knowledge Science    			


We have made tremendous progress in many fields.  We now know a lot more about the galaxies and so we do about sub-atomic world.  And this progress is being accelerated by the tools that have eolved rapidly in the last few decades to allow us to collect, store, distribute, share, and represent data.  We have to made enormous progress in information and communication. We even have developed tools to represent knowledge.  
A question keeps bothering me, however.  Have we really improved in our understanding of knowledge?  Or are our tools for understanding knowledge are still very much as they were several decades ago before the rapid progress in dealing with data started?  
I feel that our understanding of knowledge is weaker than our understanding of most of our knowledge.  And this could only change if we develop a science of knowledge — a science that uses our current knowledge about other fields to understand fundamental knowledge ecosystem.

Well, absolutely right Mr Jain..!! Science uses different approaches systematic as well as methodological to answer questions. Science is equated with knowledge, and therefore solution of problems is promoted with the development of knowledge. Science is based upon the principles of repeatability and predictability, it equates to traditional knowledge, and we must never forget that traditional knowledge is science.
Itâ€™s been ages since knowledge has been passed on from one generation to the next. Today, as well people are well aware of the fact that they must integrate knowledge into the institutions that serve them. Knowledge and science has been seen as two different factors but both come under the criteria of correlation; thus making them to work on vice-versa basis. I must say that partnerships are a vital part of any strategy that we must adopt in together seeking imaginative, innovative, and perhaps unexpected solutions.
