Welcome Iago and Nathan! 



Iago Moreira and Nathan Martins are joining us for the Summer.
Nathan has just finished his one year interchange program in North Dakota State University. Iago is half way through his program in Rochester Institute of Technology. They are both sponsored by the Brazilian Science without Borders program.
.. and they are already working with Christian on the new version of the Crowd Debug tool!
