    				Drunken Scientists and unsolvable problems    			


A drunken scientist loses the keys to his house and is looking for them under a lamppost. Another scientist comes over and asks what heâ€™s doing.
â€œIâ€™m looking for my keysâ€ he says. â€œI lost them over thereâ€.
The new scientist looks puzzled. â€œThen why are you looking for them all the way over here?
â€œBecause the light is so much better here.  We can formulate and solve the search problem much better hereâ€.
Finding the explanation reasonable, the second scientist starts looking for the keys under the lamppost.
The third scientist comes and . . . Joins the search under the lamppost.
Soon there are hundreds of scientists looking for the keys under the lamppost where the problem can be defined better.  
After long rigorous and exhaustive efforts they conclude that the problem of finding lost keys is an unsolvable problem.
