    				EventWeb article    			


The February issue of IEEE Computer magazine has a cover feature on EventWeb.  You may get a copy of the article here.
The summary of the article is given below.

Current interest in human-centered
computing suggests new
winds blowing in the computcomputing
community. HCC combines many
powerful and independent approaches
in different aspects of computing.
A combination of technological
advances, a reduction in barriers to
interactions among different parts
of the world, and the quest for solving
increasingly difficult problems
has created a potential to impact the
course of human civilization.

By the way, yours truly is the author of the paper.
