        machine learning, social computing, data visualization    







I am a first-year master student in computer science, I graduated from the University of Tehran, my research focus there was social network analysis, then I join HKUST at Hong Kong, doing research about complex network analysis. After that, I join the social computing group at the University of Trento, the research focus was human in loop machine learning. Then, I join the software engineering group at UOttawa, the research as focus on applying machine learning to predict model relaxation. Then I joined ISG group at UC Irvine, my research focus here is interactive Big Data visualization, to querying large data sets involving dimensions that include text, time, and spatial location, and also training and applying machine learning models against such datasets.
