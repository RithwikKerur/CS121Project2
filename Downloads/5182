WICS Fall Quarter Week 7: MSC Software Information Session 

 11/24/2018admin



On Thursday, November 15th, WICS hosted an information session with MSC Software. Our speakers, Stephanie and Juliana, shared their experiences in the job recruitment process, achieving graduate degrees and exposed attendees to different career opportunities for students in computer science. To get some insight on what kind of career path is right for us, everyone was given the RIASEC test to see where our interests lies. We got to share some of our results with everyone and see what we were interested in. At the end, Stephanie and Juliana were open for networking opportunities. We are extremely grateful for the chance to partner up with MSC Software and those who were able to come out to the event. We hope to see you all at the next meeting!
