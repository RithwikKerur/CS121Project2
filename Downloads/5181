WICS Fall Quarter Week 9: Casino Night 

 12/04/2018admin



On Monday, November 26, WICS hosted its very own casino night! In order to relax after midterms, students gathered with food and drinks to play all kinds of fun games. The competition got heated in blackjack, Egyptian War, and especially Mario Kart, where players bet on who would be first! In all, Casino Night was a good destresser and break from studying. Thank you to all attendees, and we hope you are refreshed to finish the quarter strong. Good luck on finals!
