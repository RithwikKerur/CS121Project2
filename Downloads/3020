    				Pervasive Computing    			


IEEE Conference on Pervasive Computing is in White Plains, New York.Â  It is being covered on Seraja — see
http://www.seraja.com/experience.jsp?eventID=603946
I gave the Key Note talk on the first day (on March 20) ‘From Pervasive Computing to EventWeb’.Â  You can download the presentation that I made by visiting the event. Sometimes one enjoys giving a talk due to the reaction of the audience.Â  And this was definitely one of the most enjoyable talk.Â  Will cover some ideas here soon.
