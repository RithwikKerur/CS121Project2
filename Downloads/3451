    				Pragyan 2010 at NIT Trichy    			


National Institute of Technology (formerly, Regional College of Engineering) in Tiruchy is one of the top engineering colleges in India.  I had an opportunity to attend part of this â€“ as a Guest Speaker and a panelist â€“ event that is completely organized by students.  I did not meet any faculty members there but was hosted by a group of very impressive students.  This also gave me a chance to interact with young talented engineering students in India.  My impressions will be discussed in a separate blog soon.
My talk was on Regaining Intellectual Leadership in the Indian context.  This was a first for me because I never addressed an audience primarily undergraduate engineering students from disparate engineering departments.  The talk is available from slideshare.
The panel was on â€˜I Do It On my own Termsâ€™.  An interesting idea, given Indian youthâ€™s current situation.  This basically was to discuss how much a young person should do it for himself and how much because what family and society wants him/her to behave in a particular way.  I enjoyed participating on the panel.
There were many other activities at this festival.  I did not get a chance to attend others.  I did attend another talk by Prof. Ramaswamy.  A very funny but very traditional Indian talk to give advice to student.
