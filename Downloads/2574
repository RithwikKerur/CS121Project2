    				Photo Database    			


The process of conversion of information in cyberspace from only textual to multimedia continues.  Now big phot collections of historical importance have announced that they will have a strong database.  NY Times article gives details of this.

This is quite significant.  This announces coming of digital age in the most respected and traditional archives.
Just yesterday at the conference that I am attending — more on this coming soon — there was discussion that many traditional sources believe that one could do a lot only with text in images and video.  ANd that is true that one could take some important early steps using text, but soon we are going to run into the deadend if we did not look into multimedia as multimedia including text, not exclusively indexing using text.
