    				Growing Old    			


Tamer Ozsu had two very interesting things to say about growing old:
1. Growing old is not for sissies.  (Attributed a lady who is 90 year old and completely independent)
2. When you stop moving, they throw dirt on you.  (From a rock band)
I liked both the above.  
(Yes I am in Singapore and having productive as well as fun time.)
