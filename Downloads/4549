San Diego Union-Tribune: “Waging war with no bombs or missiles” (Cunningham quoted)
November 1, 2016 “Cyberspace is the Wild West. There is no consensus over how nations should behave in using cyber weapons,” said Bryan Cunningham, the former CIA officer who heads UC Irvine’s new Cybersecurity Policy and Research Institute.
“There’s no treaty that specifies what cyber activities rise to the level of armed aggression warranting a response. No one knows where the lines are, and that’s a dangerous situation. An adversary could miscalculate, taking an offensive cyber action thinking it’s below the threshold for response. But the victim nation sees it differently, triggering a much larger cyber or kinetic war than intended by the attacker.”
