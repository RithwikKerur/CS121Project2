UCI Ranked #49 Worldwide for Computer Science by THE
October 18, 2017 When it comes to the best universities in the world for studying computer science, UCI is No. 49. The Times Higher Education just released its World University Rankings for the top 500 universities in engineering and technology and the top 300 universities in computer science. For engineering and technology, UCI ranked No.101-125, and for computer science, UCI cracked the top 50.
The Times Higher Education data team ranks institutions worldwide, focusing on detailed performance information across core areas of university activity — teaching and the learning environment, research, citations, international outlook, and industry income/innovation. The subject rankings use the same methodology as the World University Rankings, but they’re recalibrated based on the individual field. For computer science, slightly more weight was given to the innovation metric and slightly less to citations.
