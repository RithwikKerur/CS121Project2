 Eighth Homework
Get your work checked and signed off by a classmate, then show it to your TA in lab on Monday, March 5.
(a)  Finish up the problems from last week's homework, in particular:

Read the problem description for the amusement park simulator.

Watch the Sorting Out Sorting video

Complete the modification of your Stats program.  Everyone in this course is expected to achieve a baseline of coding proficiency in Python; even if you're not headed for software development as a career, you'll need to write some code in your subsequent classes.

(b) Some review questions for the final are on line. They're not required as part of this homework, but it would be a good idea if you were able to do these problems. (Some of the code hasn't been translated into Python, but for this purpose it should be easy enough to follow.) Answers are also available, but actually try to do the problems before looking.
(c)  Beyond that, spend your time working
  on the lab assignment.
