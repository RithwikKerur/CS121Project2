    				Nagpur Trip 2007:2    			


Seeing around Nagpur gives a clear impression that the the city is growing rapidly.  Seeing billboards of IT companies, including Global Logic, gives an impression that IT is growing here.  But the real sign of the growth is at the Airport and surrounding areas.   The airport, under construction, looks promising.
The population is still the old fashioned — not the same as Bangaluru or Hyderabad.  I guess these things take time.  Nagpur is atleast 10-15 years behind those cities.
Now I am back on my way towards home — Irvine, USA.  Will spend a day in Delhi and then 2 days in Singapore.
