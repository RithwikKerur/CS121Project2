Adriana Meza Soria


Ph.D. Software Engineering
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your graduate studies?
I chose UCI because it supports diversity and offers related funding opportunities. For example, it has an agreement with UC Mexus, one of the institutions supporting my academic development. Also, the Software Engineering program and faculty research projects in the Department of Informatics were a good fit with my academic expectations.
What has been your favorite class so far?
I just finished my first quarter here at UCI, but my favorite class was Software Engineering (IN4MTX 211), taught by David Redmiles. The class provides a big picture of software engineering from the perspective of academia.
Have you had any internships or jobs?
Before coming to UCI, I worked as a software engineer for four years in my hometown, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. I experienced first-hand the issues that software developers struggle with daily. My experience in industry helped motivate me to continue my education and work on mitigating such issues.
Can you tell us about your research?
I’m currently conducting research as a member of the Software Design and Collaboration Laboratory (SDCL) under the guidance of Professor André van der Hoek. My research focuses on improving software engineering through the simulation of real software practices supported by digital learning tools.
What has been the best part of your experience so far?
I am really enjoying life as a researcher. While earning my master’s degree, I was both working and studying, which was good because I obtained knowledge from both industry and academia. However, I like the fact that I can now dedicate all of my effort to my studies.
What are your aspirations for the future?
I’d like to work as a researcher, leading projects that both improve the quality of life for people who use technology and support the professionals who are building the technology. Specifically, I want to support software developers by providing them with novel tools and techniques for producing better software and for increasing their awareness of how software impacts society.
Any advice for prospective graduate students interested in the program?
My advice is that they should find a good match between their expectations and the projects being conducted by faculty in our department. An important factor in my success has been my passion for the work I’m doing, so I’d say they need to choose an area and topic they like.
