At the recent (Dec 2007) NIPS conference in Vancouver, six different papers were presented by PhD students and faculty from the Center. The students included Ian Porteous, Eric Linstead, and Arthur Asuncion, and researchers and faculty from the Center included Alex Ihler, Max Welling, Pierre Baldi, Dave Newman, and Padhraic Smyth. The NIPS conference is one of the major annual conferences in machine learning (over 1000 attendees) and is also highly competitive — only about 25% of submitted papers are accepted.
