    				CreativeIT    			


I am attending a workshop on CreativeIT at Arizona State University (supported by NSF:  see http://ame.asu.edu/news/creativeit/ ).  As stated

The goal of this workshop is to collaboratively determine successful strategies for promoting creativity in IT based on the experiences of a diverse group of leading practitioners.

I found myself to be the first speaker of the workshop — I talked about Storytelling using EventWeb.  My presentation is available here (at www.ics.uci.edu/~jain/presentations/Creativeit08 ).  There were speakers who shared their experience in using IT for education.  
Yesterday was half day — toay will be the full day dedicated more to creativity issues more directly.  The most interesting aspect of this workshop is the diversity of people who are invited to talk.

You were right — I made a simple typo — it should be working now.
Thanks for pointing that out.
