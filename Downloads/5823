OC Register: “Edison High School students study cyber savvy” (Ito quoted)

January 28, 2015


By Lauren Williams
Now schools are tapping into Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to connect with students. And students have learned what is appropriate to share.
“I think that message of ‘Facebook is forever’ and ‘authorities are looking at it’ has come through. It is no longer a safe space for peer sharing,” said Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist at UC Irvine specializing in how young people use social media in the U.S. and Japan. “I don’t think teenagers see Facebook as their peer communication space anymore. It’s more like how we treat email: it’s here to stay but it’s not the fun, new edgy space that it was once.”

South China Morning Post: “The Facebook afterlife: what happens to your digital footprint when you die?” (Brubaker quoted)

December 7, 2014


By Lana Lam
Facebook, which has 1.3 billion users, offers two options: the account can be deleted permanently upon the family’s request or it can be converted into a memorial profile. … Jed Brubaker, an academic at the University of California, Irvine who is researching death, identity and social networks, said this Facebook option was a double-edged sword.

New York Times: “Click Bait Is a Distracting Affront to Our Focus,” by Gloria Mark

November 25, 2014


The grand challenge associated with our digital age is maintaining focus of attention. On average, people switch their focus of attention when working with digital media about every three minutes. The design of personal computers, smart devices and, of course, the Internet all contribute to this fragmentation of our attention. Click bait as a design element is a natural evolution, and consequence, of the Internet that affects our flow of attention.
Our research has shown that attention distraction can lead to higher stress, a bad mood and lower productivity. While we can’t blame all attention distraction on click bait, as with any addictive relationship, it is an enabler. When we switch our attention to a new activity, the cognitions that we used in the first task remain as we transition to the subsequent task. This attention residue adds to our cognitive load as we keep switching our focus of attention and trying to reorient to new topics. Once overloaded, we tend to do more lightweight activities. And that makes us even more susceptible to the lure of click bait.

The Kernel: “11 women who are changing geek culture” (Karen Tanenbaum featured)

November 9, 2014


By Ann Hoevel
While popular culture has invested a lot of screentime in the archetype of the nerdy white guy, women in geek culture have, for a long time, been invisible. But that in no way means they don’t exist. Though comic book, technology, and gaming industries have historically catered to men, women have always been a part of them—both as consumers and as creators—outside the spotlight.

Time: “How You Can Stop Email From Taking Over Your Life” (Mark quoted)

September 19, 2014


By Eric Barker
A new study released Thursday by the University of California, Irvine, which was co-written with United States Army researchers, found that people who do not look at e-mail on a regular basis at work are less stressed and more productive. “We were able to get second-by-second stress levels from our tests and we found that over the five-day period away from e-mail, people’s stress levels went down compared with when they were using e-mails,” Ms. [Gloria] Mark said.
