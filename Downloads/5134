WICS Fall Quarter Week 2: Mentorship Mixer 

 10/30/2020admin



On Monday, October 12th 2020 of Week 2, roughly 100 prospective mentors and mentees attended WICS‚Äô annual mentorship mixer! About 40 mentors and 60 mentees gathered together and mingled through ‚Äúspeed friending‚Äù, in which groups of members were placed into breakout rooms and answered questions about each other. As each group returned to the main session after each round of speed friending, everyone participated in a poll about which Disney character would be a better mentor (as this year‚Äôs mentorship theme is Disney!). We hope everyone had fun and made some new connections! üôÇ
