    				Inspirational thoughts    			


I saw some thoughts expressed by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in Fortune.
I like that Bill Gates has Robinhood in him.
Warren Buffett sounds almost a democrat in his views and I loved his ideas about leaving only about 1% of his money for children so they can also experience flat world — though from a small hill.
