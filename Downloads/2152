Computer Science and Software Engineering Professional Programs Showcase Student Success
January 12, 2021 
On Dec. 17, 2020, the Master of Computer Science (MCS) and Master of Software Engineering (MSWE) programs held their first-ever virtual Capstone Showcase. The two professional programs, offered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), joined forces this year to highlight the 142 students graduating on Dec. 18, showcasing their innovative projects. Both the graduation and showcase were virtual because of the pandemic, but that didn’t stop the students from presenting live, 15-miniutes pitches and demos over Zoom for the showcase. They then answered questions from the more than 80 guests in attendance, including industry professionals and UCI colleagues.

“We are really happy with how it turned out,” says Jessica Shanahan, the program manager for MCS. “At the end of the evening, students were congratulating each other on a job well done. They had a lot of fun and were thankful for this experience.”
MCS and MSWE students closed out the virtual showcase with a UCI Zot, Zot, Zot!
The Inaugural MSWE CohortThis was the first graduating cohort for the MSWE program. The 34 graduates started their 15-month journey in September 2019. After spending an estimated 1,300 hours writing, reading, analyzing and testing code, these students spent the final quarter of the program designing and implementing their capstone project. Students worked in teams, delivering the following 10 projects:
ACED (ANTrepreneur Center Entrepreneurship Database) is a system that effectively manages student profiles and entrepreneurial activities (Junxian Chen, Wen-Chia Yang, Zihua Weng, Rafael Oliveira).Chat Roulette is a speed-dating feature for the Clowdr virtual conferencing platform (Bingfei Zhang, Yijia Zhang, Xiling Li).MACMODS is a web-based mapping solution that visualizes the potential of building and operating seaweed farms to maximize the macroalgal yield in California (Soobin Choi, Duo Chai, Guowei Li, Tianyu Qi).Helpgram lets you ask others for help with tasks such as grocery shopping, or you can offer to help others, perhaps picking up a prescription for an elderly neighbor (Aman Bhatia, Anjana Krishnakumar Vellore, Santhiya Nagarajan, Vaishakhi Pilankar).Spell-with-Maven is a web application that helps young children learn spelling (Tianlun Li, Zeyu Huang, Yue Zhang).SpiderSense is a software testing platform that can show line-level coverage data and automatically get new commits from GitHub (Dongxin Xiang, Jing Chen, Weihuan Fu, Marc Andrada).Surfline is a custom news feed delivering the latest in surf forecast journalism (Nicolas Grantham).Team1 developed a financial projection tool that allows faculty at UCI’s Stem Cell Research Center to efficiently consolidate and manipulate financial data (Harry Duong, Armin Hamidi, Thuc Nguyen, Chunqi (Deon) Zhao).UnoKiwi is a state of the art, easy-to-use iOS application for clothing design and customization (Xiaolue Peng, Shikun Xiong, Yilin Wang, Yitian Ma).The WorkerDrones team enhanced CloudStation, a cloud-based drone piloting system (Chris Zhang, Hyun Jay Yang, Lindsey Garcia).
During the virtual showcase, Vaishakhi Pilankar presents a demo of her team’s Helpgram application, where people can ask for help (in buying bread, for example) or offer their assistance to others (with grocery shopping, for example).
More than 100 MCS GraduatesEighty-nine percent of the previous MCS cohort, which graduated in 2019, secured full-time employment within three months of graduation, and 71% received salaries between $100,000 and $150,000 at companies such as Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Tesla and Yahoo. Of the 2020 cohort, 72% had already secured employment prior to their December graduation.
“MCS offers a comprehensive understanding of computer science with the variety of subjects it has to offer,” says Junaid Jabbar Magdum, an international student who joined the program right after completing his undergraduate education. “From resume workshops to career fair preparation seminars, the program helps you make significant strides in securing a job. Furthermore, the professors and staff are extremely helpful and are available at all times, which makes MCS a clear choice for any student looking at a Master’s program.”
Magdum was one the 108 students in the 2020 cohort, and his team’s capstone project used gaming to help people learn how to better protect themselves against COVID-19. In fact, more than a handful of the 36 projects dealt with either the pandemic directly or healthcare more generally:
BattleCovid-19 is a 2D platformer game designed to spread awareness about the safety measures for COVID-19 (Isha Manoj Pongde, Junaid Jabbar Magdum, Ritwick Verma).Dynamic Duo is a virtual health journaling software that helps senior patients prepare for doctor visits (Yixing Wang, Jing Yu).Focus Now helps students find places to study during pandemic (Hanying Leng, Hua Chen, Siyi Le, Zhihong Zhang).Treehole Online provides an anonymous web-based platform for people to share their feelings and lives (Zehua Peng , Yuhao Dai , Jiaming Mo).MyFitPlanner generates and tracks personalized workout routines to achieve your fitness goals (Bryan Roth, Joshua Sun, Huanzhi Zhang).PharmEasy integrates and streamlines healthcare services with Secured Data Store using Blockchain (Rushikesh Joshi, Romit Shah, Ankitesh Gupta).Virtue Office is a web-based 2D online game that connects distant people, boosts their productivity, and brings joy to the virtual workplace (Chung-Yu Chi, Siyu Shi, Yuanbo Han, Zhanyan Zhu).
