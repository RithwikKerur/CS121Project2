The FLAMINGO Project on Data Cleaning







The FLAMINGO Project on Data Cleaning
Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine

Objective
 The Flamingo Project focuses on data cleaning, i.e., how to
deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems.  As an
example, in many applications such as data integration, commercial
organizations need to collect data from various sources to conduct
analysis and make decisions. Often, the data from these different
sources can have inconsistencies. For instance, we use first name,
last name, SSN, and birthday to identify a person. However, the same
name, e.g., "Schwarzenegger", may be misspelled as "Swarzzengaer" or
other forms. Such errors make it more challenging to link records from
different places and answer queries approximately.  We are developing
algorithms in order to make query answering and information retrieval
efficient in the presence of such inconsistencies and errors.

With the NSF
award IIS-0844574,
we plan to study the following problems.  Supporting fuzzy queries is
becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal
with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures, representations,
or semantics.  Many existing algorithms require an offline analysis of
data sets to construct an efficient index structure to support online
query processing. Fuzzy join queries of data sets are more time
consuming due to the computational complexity.  The PI is studying
three research problems: (1) constructing high-quality inverted lists
for fuzzy search queries using Hadoop; (2) supporting fuzzy joins of
large data sets using Hadoop; and (3) using the developed techniques
to improve data quality of large collections of documents.

With the NSF
award 1030002,
we will study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient
indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding-computing
infrastructure. A main application is supporting
family reunification in disasters
such as the Haiti Earthquake.  Check our portals for
the Haiti Earthquake
and Chile Earthquake.  The
main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the
cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms.
