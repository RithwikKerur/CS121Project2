Self-Discovery

A critical part of career planning is assessing who you are.  Taking time for self-discovery allows you the opportunity to clarify your potential career paths and guides you through different life transitions.  When you are self-aware, you can then see yourself through the lens of hiring managers.  Whether they are at Google, Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), Blizzard, Salesforce, Airbnb, SpaceX or Calm, all hiring managers want to know:


What experience do you bring to the table?
What strengths can you contribute to my team?
What is your potential here?
Do I want to work with you every day?


The following assessments will help you understand your unique interests, values, strengths, gaps, motivations, and work preferences:


16Personalities.com (MBTI Test)
O*Net Interest Profiler


Career Exploration

As technology continues to evolve, so will your career.  As such, it is important to start thinking about and exploring career opportunities beyond your summer internship and post-graduation employment.  Whether your first position is a software engineer, developer, data engineer, UX designer, etc., you will grow professionally and personally, and there will be a “next position.”   What does that look like?


What does your short-term (6 – 12 months) career plan look like?
What does your long-term (3 – 5 years) career plan look like?
What is your career track and outlook?


Here are some tools that will help you explore career tracks, opportunities, salary, and career outlook:
