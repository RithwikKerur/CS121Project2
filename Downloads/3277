    				Memories For Life    			


While in Singapore, I met Wendy Hall and Nigel Shadbolt.  They mentioned the ‘Memories for Life’ (M4F) project in UK.  Very interesting project.  One can visit this project at: http://www.memoriesforlife.org/
The project description says:

We are our memories. Our memories underpin every thought we have, every fact we learn and every skill we acquire. 
In todayâ€™s technology-rich society this human memory is now supplemented by increasing amounts of personal digital information; emails, photographs, Internet telephone calls, even GPS locations and television viewing logs. 

Our project EMME (Experiential Media Management Environment) has a similar philosophy.  We have been a bit unfocused on this project.  By pulling together several things happening in our group under one umbrella, we can make good progress on this project.  But this is easy to say, difficult to do in academic environment.
