WICS Fall Quarter 2017 Week 2: Mentorship Mixer 

 10/11/201711/08/2017Diana Sandil



Whoo! On Monday, Oct. 9th, WICS hosted their first WICS Mentorship program event: Mentorship Mixer. After consuming pizza and snacks, people settled down and we started our mentor introductions. Mentors filled out their profiles online before the mixer, so mentees did get a chance to view potential mentors before the mixer. Once introductions were complete, mentees chose their top 3 mentors to chat with and from there, both mentors and mentees were able to fill out their preferences. From there, we shall wait until the Mentorship Reveal during week 5 to see the final pairing results.
