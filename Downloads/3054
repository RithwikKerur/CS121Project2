    				Colorful reading    			


A very interesting idea — to redefineÂ alphabet in colors rather than balack and white shapes — to chage the way we read is proposed.
Freedman has been working on Kromofons–an innovative alphabet in which the 26 English letters are represented solely by individual colors–waiting for technology to catch up with him.
And now, thanks to the Internet, the ubiquity of color monitors, Microsoft Word plug-ins and his being able to launch a Kromofons-based e-mail system, Freedman thinks he is finally ready.
Of course, there are many issues with this, but it definitely sounds like a fun thing.
