    				Indian Technology in the Flat World    			


The flat world offers some exciting opportunities to developing countries.Â  I was invited to talk in Indian-American Society of San Diego on this topic.Â  I have been thinking about this topic so I was only happy to share my ideas and views with people there.Â  My presentation is available here.
After the talk, discussions continued for quite some time — for about one hour.Â  It was interesting to see perspectives of people — most people believe that there is a great opportunity, but there are serious challenges also.Â  On the other hand, some people appeared to be defensive and did not want to think about the challenges.
I think that this is the best time India has seen since becoming independent.Â  It can maintain the growth trajectory provided it appreciates the challenges.Â  I am definitely interested in exploring these challenges.Â  In any case, I enjoyed giving this talk.
