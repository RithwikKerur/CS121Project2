About
Hi! I am currently working as a Postdoc at the Secure Systems and Software Lab of Prof. Michael Franz at the University of California, Irvine.

My research mostly focuses on low-level system security aspects, such as kernel/userland isolation, compiler-based software analysis, and mitigating software-exploitable hardware vulnerabilities.

I also have a personal webpage.
