Winter 2021 Week 1: WICS First General Meeting 

 02/19/202104/23/2021admin



On Monday, January 4, 2020, of Week 1, WICS held the First General Meeting for the winter quarter. WICS members and members from the ICS community came together to learn more about WICS, WICS Board and Committee, and upcoming WICS events! After the introduction, a light-hearted pop quiz was held, as an opportunity for general members to win exclusive WICS swag for free! Closing off the night, members broke up into breakout rooms for two rounds of bonding activities, such as playing games like Bomb Party, Skribbl.io, and Among Us.
