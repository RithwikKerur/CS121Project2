KUCI Office Hours Podcast: “Keeping Up with Coronavirus Statistics” (Vladimir Minin interviewed)
September 28, 2020 
When the pandemic hit, UC Irvine professor of statistics Vladimir Minin began moving quickly into action. Working with his colleagues, he developed two websites to display numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Orange County and all of California. Join us as we discuss trends of cases, how to understand statistics, and his process of collecting information and presenting it to the public. The websites can be reached here (https://www.stat.uci.edu/covid19/index.html) and here (https://www.stat.uci.edu/oc_covid_model/index.html).
Listen to the podcast at KUCI: Office Hours.
