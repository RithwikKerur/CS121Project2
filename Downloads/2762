    				Proposals and proposals    			


Lately it seems that my life is filled with proposals.  I am working on several proposals to raise funding for my research at UCI to build a strong research group in Event-based systems.  It seems that most of my research is strongly driven by the desire to bring events to the center of thinking to deal with dynamic information.  I am excited about the research topic but writing proposals is a time consuming task.  Well as they say, you have to pay your dues and writing proposals is paying your dues for doing interesting research.
Hopefully beginning next week the situation will improve in this respect.
