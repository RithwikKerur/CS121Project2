abstract = {Advances in computing steadily erode computer security at its foundation, and call for fundamental innovations to strengthen current practices in computer security, specifically in applied cryptography, from theory to standardization to actual implementations. At the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, software defined networks and Internet of Everything, demands devices to adopt an increasing number of security standards - with a diverse set of cryptographic primitives. This in turn calls for innovations in security beyond the foundational aspects, down to the actual design and deployment of such primitives and protocols while satisfying conflicting design constraints such as latency, compactness, and energy efficiency. The advent of Quantum computing threatens to break many classical cryptographic schemes, leading to innovations in public key cryptography that focus on post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols that are resistant to quantum computing threats. In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both in terms of foundational properties, as well as its application to both traditional and emerging security problems such as encryption (asymmetric, but also symmetric), digital signature, key exchange, homomorphic encryption etc. While such techniques provide guarantees in theory, their realization on contemporary computing platforms requires careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity of computing platforms (e.g., high-performance to resource constrained), as well as agility for deployment in the face of emerging and changing standards. In this work we survey trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs for their adoption.},
