    				Slow    			


I have been slow in everything for the last one week — had very bad cold and flu, which I was told today, has become mild Bronchoitis.  So I am now on antibiotics.  Should be back to normal life in a few days.
Things are happeningin interesting way, however.  I am amazed on how video is catching on.  Will have to post something on that.
