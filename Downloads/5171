WICS Winter Quarter Week 1: First General Meeting 

 01/14/201904/08/2019admin



On January 9th, WICS hosted the first general meeting of 2019 in DBH 6011! There were around 50 students who attended this event. Students were all happily chatting with each other and eating pizza before the presentation started. WICS’ Co-Presidents Princess Pancubit and Crystal Agerton welcomed all members and introduced WICS’ upcoming events for winter quarter. During the meeting, we had a raffle to give out swag bags, and some lucky attendees got them. After the meeting, we had an after event at UTC to hang out and know more about each other. We had a great start to the new quarter and hope everyone has a great year!
