Two faculty affiliated with the UCI Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems have been elected as 2021 AAAS Fellows, joining 190 other AAAS Fellows at UC Irvine.  Rina Dechter, Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean for Research in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences, was elected for contributions to computational aspects of automated reasoning and knowledge representation, including search, constraint processing, and probabilistic reasoning, and for service to the computing community.  Padhraic Smyth, Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science and Associate Director of the UCI Center for Machine Learning, was elected for distinguished contributions to the field of machine learning, particularly the development of statistical foundations and methodologies. 
 Congratulations to them both!
