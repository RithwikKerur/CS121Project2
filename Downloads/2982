    				Back Home 070108    			


Finally after about one month of travelling a lot, I am back home.Â  Though I am alone back home, it feels very good.Â 
Took the long flight — non stop from SIngapore to LAX — and did not sleep much on the flight.
Now I have to start preparing for class, get thru the mail, and get house in order.Â  Currently the smoke detector is chirping — changed the battery but it is still complaining.Â  SO I need to pay attention — will do tomorrow.Â  Today I am going to sleep — even with that noise.
