Karp Distinguished Lecture Series, providing a sweeping overview of three great threads in matching theory (stable matching, market equilibria, and online matching), and concluding with a 40-year-old open problem connected to finding a polynomial-time algorithm for the Hylland-Zeckhauser market equilibrium.
