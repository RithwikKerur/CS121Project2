Personal History Statement (Optional, but highly recommended)

Your personal history describing circumstances that have contributed to your successes and/or challenges encountered during your academic and/or professional career.


Supplemental Questions

Describe your past experiences with software engineering and programming that you have produced, including your role, the complexity, and language. If you consider yourself a career changer, please briefly explain here.
(Domestic applicants only): If you intend to register in the program part-time, please describe your full-time position (i.e. job title, employer, location). Your response here is for informational purposes only and can change, if necessary, before matriculation into the program. Note: Only domestic applicants can enroll part-time. 


Unofficial Transcripts

Scan and upload the front and back of unofficial transcripts from all postsecondary studies. Uploaded transcripts should include the following: your name, dates of attendance, grades/marks received, credits and grading legend.
Note: Official transcripts will be requested if you are admitted and accept our offer of admission. Do not send official transcripts until this time.


Official Test Scores

If applicable, select ONE test of English language proficiency.  For complete information, including minimum scores, waivers, and how to submit official test scores, please visit Graduate Division’s English Language Proficiency Requirements for Admissions:.

TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)
IELTS (International English Language Testing System)


The GRE Exam is OPTIONAL. Submitting a GRE score does not necessarily increase your chances for admission. GRE scores may be taken into consideration for admission, in some cases (for example, your undergraduate institution has no track record or your GPA is low). In lieu of GRE scores, applicants are highly recommended to submit any additional material that enriches the application and speaks to the applicant’s strengths:

Design portfolio
Link to GitHub profile
Scholarly papers submitted and/ or published
Writing samples


If GRE Test scores are included, please take the following into consideration:

To avoid delays, official test scores should be requested to be sent at the time of exam from the testing agency to UC Irvine (Institution Code 4859). 
Photocopies or scans of test results will not be accepted. 
GRE scores are valid for five years. 




Three Letters of Recommendation

A minimum of three letters of recommendation from individuals who can evaluate your academic and/or professional achievements, describe your strengths and weaknesses, and comment on your character, integrity, and motivation. Letters which speak to your ability to perform in a post-graduate academic program are especially useful.  Letters may be from professors, work/internship supervisors, or others as appropriate. Letters from family members or personal references will not be accepted.
