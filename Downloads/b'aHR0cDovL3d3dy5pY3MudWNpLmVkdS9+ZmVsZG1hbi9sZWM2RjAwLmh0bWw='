[interview with JSB]
Chapter 8--Re-education
	Basic theme: computers and the web are not going to eliminate the
world as we know it. best solution is to use them to augment and improve what we have.

			people and money
			PARC, Microsoft
		c. New Technologies

			Do things more cheaply
	2. The New Model
		25 Courses make up half the curriculum in two-year schools
		and one-third of the curriculum in four-year school--too much
		centralization
		The Hype problem--

		a. What is it?
		b. What's important about it?

Lecture Six--Comparisons
Productivity
Whalen, Charles J. High-Tech hustle sweeps the nation, BW, 16 Oct, 98, 100 ®

Commerce Department: "…productivity gains … 
are far more widely spread than anyone would have expected."
Productivity rose 2-2.4% in every region of U.S.
Why? Hi-tech industries are everywhere
Ripple--
	Finance in Northeast
	Improved manufacturing productivity in Midwest
Even spread
-------------------------------------------------------------

Uchitelle, Louis. In a productivity surge, no proof of a 'new economy', NY Times, 8 Oct, Bu 6
95-98--Burst of prosperity
Computer at heart, but not because it transformed the world
"Computers have indeed lifted the economy,
but mainly through the manufacture of the computers
themselves and the production of semiconductors,
communications equipment, software and other
computer-related devices."
Maybe affect other sectors later.
How will it affect other sectors?
	Revolution--like biotech may revolutionize medicine
	Evolution--small increments
Ripple effect--only 25% from 95-98
Not the kind of impact others (electric motor,
Internal combusiton engine) produced.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Comparisons--G4 Cube
Mossberg. Apple's Design Delight: Cube is beautiful, silent, and powerful, WSJ, 28 Sep, B1 http://ptech.wsj.com ®
Beautiful, with beautiful, spherical, transparent speakers
15" flat panel display in transparent housing
performed very well--ran all software I threw at it.
	Surfed web, email, silent (no fan)
$1799 price is comparable to windows machine
	with same spec's.
Downsides
	Disk drives: no floppy, no CD-RW, only DVD
	Price: For $1799, you should get 128 MB RAM, not 64
			And >20 GB of hard disc
Goodies
	Connectors and ports on bottom
	Handle to lift guts, antennas for wireless networking
	New keyboard, new mouse
 -------------------------------------------------
Wildstrom, Stephen. The Cube: Looks Aren't Everything,
BW, 16 Oct, 29 ®
Imac proves that style matters
G4 proves that style is far from everything
Cube is an object of real beauty.
No fan, but power supply in a brick
Big keyboard, nice mouse 

but mouse doesn't have two buttons
but mouse doesn't have scroll wheel

Overpriced and underfeatured and no clear target audience
	Overpriced for students, families, and schools
		(a major Mac constituency)
		At 1799 plus 500 or 1000 for a monitor
	Underfeatured for creative professionals
		Can't use dual monitors
		Drive problem--missing CDRW or floppy
			DVD drive not very useful
			Hooking up outside drive ruins aesthetic
		Dual processors, but software can't use them
