About Us
Mission & Vision









ICS Student Council was created by passionate  students for all interested students.





Our Mission






Improve
Student life of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences academically, socially, and professionally.





Create and Deepen
Bonds between students, faculty, administration, companies, and alumni of the ICS School as well as similar groups.







Our Vision
We believe that through a strong community, we will enhance the quality of student life and ensure great jobs for students of all majors and minors within the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science by:




Understanding, disseminating, and contributing to departmental decisions including curriculum, research, and hiring decisions
Creating a network of alumni which will provide students with opportunities to grow while in school, and opportunities after graduation to leverage that growth
Provide one another with tools and opportunities to become the most competitive technical experts in the world




Developing nontechnical skills such as leadership, team building, and advocacy outside of the classroom that will ultimately determine success in the rest of our careers
Informing students about the immense opportunities that are available on the UC Irvine campus, in the neighboring community, and throughout the world
Creating partnerships between the academics of our campus and the related industries






              Learn more through our constitution.
