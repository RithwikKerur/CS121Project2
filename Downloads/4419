CML Researchers win NAACL Paper Award Standard

July 25, 2022
News



Congratulations to CML PhD student Robert Logan, and his advisor Prof. Sameer Singh, who received a Best New Task Paper Award at the 2022 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL).  Their method, FRUIT: Faithfully Reflecting Updated Information in Text, uses language models to automatically update articles (like those on Wikipedia) when new evidence is obtained. This work is motivated not only by a desire to assist the volunteers who maintain Wikipedia, but by the ways it pushes the boundaries of the NLP field.
