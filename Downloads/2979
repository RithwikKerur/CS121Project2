    				Camera with Face Detection Technology    			


Fuji Film announced launch of a camera with face detection technology.Â  See a report from News.com.
In this version face detection is used to adjust focal length and other parameters.Â  I expect that soon we will see more features with computer vision applied to get more metadata for photos that will become part of standard metadata stored in cameras.

Very soon many of the integral items of use will involve vision. The Lenovo Laptop is now coming with Face Recognition.  Vision has the opportunity to come very close to everyday life. And it will not be far away when this actually does.
