CML faculty Xiaohui Xie and Chen Li awarded $662k NIH grant Standard

March 3, 2013
News



Computer science faculty Xiaohui Xie and Chen Li have been awarded a three-year grant of nearly $662,000 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop new computational tools essential for future advances in sequencing human genomes. The primary goal of the NIH-funded research is to develop computational algorithms and open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of next-generation sequencing analysis tools and expand the accessibility of those tools to previously understudied regions of the genome.
