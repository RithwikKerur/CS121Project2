Lee uses crowdsourcing to predict World Cup outcome Standard

August 18, 2014
News



Center member and Professor of Cognitive Science Michael Lee, in partnership with
Ranker, are using the wisdom of the crowd to predict the outcome of the World Cup. Lee and his collaborators developed a model that integrates multiple sources of ranking information available from participating individuals, along with bracket information, to make an overall prediction on each country’s likelihood of winning.  See their blog post for more information.
Update: After the tournament, Lee and his collaborators have also analyzed their performance relative to other World Cup prediction models.
