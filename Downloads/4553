I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Electrical
and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California, San Diego. I
am affiliated with the Mobile Systems
Design Lab at UCSD. My research focuses on Computing and Communications for Intelligent and
Autonomous systems in the Internet-of-things (IoT). My work spans the areas of Computing Systems,
Networking, Edge-Cloud Computing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Cyber-physical and
Autonomous Systems. My recent research directions have been on the
energy-efficient collaborative computing, and effective task partitioning in resource constrained Autonomous Systems, e.g.,
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), using optimal computaion offloading over
the edge-cloud.  I am
working on architecting flexible, adaptive and reconfigurable
computing framework with multi-objectve optimizations for advanced AI-based Systems, along with optimal distributed Vehicular Edge Computing
over hybrid V2X Wireless Networks including 5G mmWave, LTE, C-V2X, WiFi and
D2D technologies.
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science
from University of California,
Irvine in 2019 and Masters in Computer Science from University of Texas
at Dallas in 2013. In Summer 2012, I was a visiting researcher in
the
WINLAB of Rutgers University, NJ.  I
have had research internship
experience in Nokia Bell Labs, Huawei Research labs and Blackberry, as
well as prior work experience as a software engineer in Cisco Systems
and as a systems engineer at IBM.
