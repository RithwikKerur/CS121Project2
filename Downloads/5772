MIT Sloan Management Review: “Why Time Signals Still Matter When Working Remotely” (Co-authored by Melissa Mazmanian)

May 4, 2020


Managing remote workers is a challenge under the best of circumstances, but during the coronavirus pandemic, these challenges are amplified. Most people are new to working remotely. Many are juggling work and caring for children who are home while schools are closed. Others are cut off from key relationships and sources of support. Everyone is coping with unprecedented uncertainty and disruption. And everyone is anxious — about health, money, and the future.

Undergraduate Informatics Course Offers Real-World Lessons on Inclusive Human-Centered Design

April 27, 2020


“Today is going to be a little experimental,” announced Informatics Professor Stacy Branham as she stood at the front of an Anteater Learning Pavilion (ALP) lecture hall back in January and introduced her IN4MATX 131 students to a panel of speakers:
Jenaro Soto, a third-year Ph.D. student in pharmaceutical sciences at UCI and a wheelchair user;Maya Gupta, a master’s student in informatics at UCI studying wayfinding technology for people with disabilities; and Cella Sum, a software engineer at Big Cartel and a student in UCI’s master of human-computer interaction and design (MHCID) program.

A Chain of Giving Back: Rosalva Gallardo Valencia and Adriana Meza Soria

April 24, 2020


(Este artículo está disponible en Español)
When Rosalva Gallardo Valencia was awarded the Miguel Velez fellowship for Latin American graduate students in 2009, she became a link in a chain that, a decade later, would extend to Adriana Meza Soria, currently a doctoral student in software engineering at UCI. The significance of this chain was highlighted at the 2020 Hall of Fame Celebration for the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), when Gallardo Valencia, a 2020 Hall of Fame inductee and featured speaker at the event, recalled receiving the award so many years ago.

UCI News: “UCI faculty create curricula for kids worldwide confined by coronavirus” (Bill Tomlinson mentioned)

April 22, 2020


On this Earth Day, the United Nations is announcing the start of a new environmental education program for the world’s 1.5 billion youth who are confined to their homes to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and unable to physically attend school. Informatics Professor Bill Tomlinson helped in crafting the curricula.

ACM: “Amid COVID-19 Travel Restrictions, World’s Leading Computing Society Releases Report on Best Practices for Virtual Conferences” (Crista Lopes and Gary Olson mentioned)

April 16, 2020


Science and technology conferences are engines of innovation—essential to the incubation of new ideas, the dissemination of research, and the spawning of new technologies. But this year, with no warning, conferences around the globe are finding themselves in uncharted waters as the global COVID-19 pandemic makes physical meetings impossible. To help organizers cope, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has issued a new report, “Virtual Conferences: A Guide to Best Practices,” on how to replace face-to-face conferences with virtual ones during the pandemic.

Raising Good Gamers: Katie Salen-Tekinbaş Tackles Online Toxicity with New Initiative





How might we develop and support gaming communities that cultivate empathetic, compassionate and civically engaged kids? This is the question Informatics Professor Katie Salen Tekinbaş aims to address through a new Connected Learning Lab (CLL) initiative she is working on called Raising Good Gamers.

Informatics Professor Crista Lopes Co-Chairs Task Force on Best Practices for Virtual Conferences

April 15, 2020



The list of cancelled events amid the current coronavirus pandemic is long, but while some are choosing to postpone rather than cancel, others are going virtual. In trying to help colleagues move conferences online, it quickly became apparent to Informatics Professor Crista Lopes, who has been involved with online conferencing for years, that a set of guidelines was needed to ease the transition.

The Atlantic: “We Need to Stop Trying to Replicate the Life We Had” (Melissa Mazmanian quoted)




Obviously, some aspects of prepandemic life can’t be re-created or replaced. In person, humans can sync up to one another through gaze and body language—which is impossible over phone or text, and difficult over videochat. Melissa Mazmanian, an associate informatics professor at UC Irvine, recently had to switch from in-person to Zoom interviews for a research project, “and some of them just don’t work as well,” she said. “I can’t read [subjects’] body language and help them feel comfortable in the way that I can when I’m there.”

Los Angeles Times : “Online COVID-19 diaries are helping people cope. They’re also a research gold mine” (Sean Young quoted)

April 10, 2020



Daily COVID-19 diaries have multiplied across social media. Sean Young, an associate professor at UCLA and UC Irvine who studies digital behavior and prediction technology, said such social media sharing is to be expected during a health crisis like this. Researchers have been mining the internet for digital journals for various research projects that are helping healthcare workers tackle the coronavirus crisis. For example, in January, researchers at the University of California Institute for Prediction Technology were tracking Baidu search engine data in China when the virus was first spreading. The researchers are now doing the same in the U.S., developing artificial-intelligence-based models that take social media data, such as these daily symptom journals, to predict hospitalization rates before hospitals become overwhelmed.
