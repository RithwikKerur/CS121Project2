    				Go To Mumbai!    			


The latest mind-numbing event in Mumbai are exceptional for showing the daring twist in terrorism, unpreparedness, despite multiple such events, to deal with any such situation by Mumbai, and exceptional diversity of Mumbai in terms of good and bad, of intolerant masses and broad-mineded intellectuals, and obviously the financial aspects of its residents.  The implication of this event is  going to be debated for long time time not only in the context of Mumbai but India.  
Keeping out of places where terrorists struck is giving into terrorists and crowning them victorious.  I reall liked the following Op-Ed in NYT bySuketu Mehta:
But the best answer to the terrorists is to dream bigger, make even more money, and visit Mumbai more than ever. Dream of making a good home for all Mumbaikars, not just the denizens of $500-a-night hotel rooms. Dream not just of Bollywood stars like Aishwarya Rai or Shah Rukh Khan, but of clean running water, humane mass transit, better toilets, a responsive government. Make a killing not in Godâ€™s name but in the stock market, and then turn up the forbidden music and dance; work hard and party harder.
