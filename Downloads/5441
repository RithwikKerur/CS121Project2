Bonnie Nardi















































  
I am a faculty member in the Department of Informatics 
        in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the 
        University of California, Irvine. In 2014, I was awarded an honorary doctorate, “Doctor Honoris Causa,” from the University of Umeå in Sweden, for which I am very grateful. I was elected to the CHI Academy in 2013. I co-edit, with Kirsten Foot and Victor Kaptelinin, the MIT Press Acting with Technology Series which has many award-winning titles. I am a founding member of the ICS Center for Research on Sustainability, Collapse-preparedness and Information Technology at UC Irvine and of the Computing within LIMITS Workshop. 







New Book!

        My newest book, just published by MIT Press, and co-authored with Hamid Ekbia at Indiana University, is Heteromation and Other Stories of Computing and Capitalism. It’s not long but we worked on it a long time.

Activity 
        theory proposes that consciousness is shaped by practice, that people 
        and artifacts mediate our relationship with reality. Consciousness is 
        produced in the enactment of activity with other people and things, rather 
        than being something confined inside a human head. Activity theory began 
        in Russia with the work of Lev Vygotsky in the 1920's, continuing through 
        his student Aleksey Leontiev, and then through students of Leontiev. This 
        work has been influential in education, organizational design, and interaction 
        design. Activity theory works well with design because activity theorists 
        have always tested their theories in practical ways and believe that application 
        is an outcome of theory, not a separate activity. In some of my writings 
        I have discussed how, as a psychological theory, activity theory can be 
        scaled to collaborative settings without losing sight of individual participants 
        in an activity.
        
         I am a Senior Editor for Mind, Culture, and Activity, a journal devoted to activity theory.

The 
        computer desktop was an amazing design for its time, but does not reflect 
        the complexity, flexibility, and sociality of human activity. Based on 
        my research, I have developed several designs that I believe would enhance 
        the desktop, if it were possible to take them past the prototype stage 
        and onto actual desktops. I hope the ideas will find their way into the 
        designs of others. Eventually we will have to reorganize the desktop to 
        reflect the complex mix of activities users engage in and move beyond 
        the rigidity of separate applications and files-and-folders. Activity 
        theory will be useful in this effort as we work to characterize activity. 
        While ingenious technologies such as blogs and wikis have improved communication, 
        we need better ways to use digital technologies to organize multiple activities, 
        establish meaningful contexts for different activities, and collaborate 
        with others. A different level of design and implementation is needed 
        to make that happen.

 There 
        is a strong need to find new ways to think about the social and cultural 
        changes that come with new technologies and to think about new technologies to address pressing social problems. My current work concerns labor and computing and long-term environmental sustainability.
