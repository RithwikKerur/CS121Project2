    				Video Phones — Finally    			


According to an article in Forbes,
“Videophones,” heralded as early as the 1964 World’s Fair, have never really caught on. But increasingly sophisticated mobile devices and wireless networks, cheaper data plans and consumer enthusiasm for mobile video may brighten its prospects.
This is really happening now.  Many people use their skype or similar services regularly to do ‘videophone’ everyday — I know we do this everyday with Neil in Singapore and Sudha (or I) in Irvine.  This has kep us really connected.  And this will be a great step in communication and maintaining connectivity and close relationships.
