Coming from Abroad


Our research crosses countries and continents on a regular basis, for instance comparing the impact of innovation practices and resulting technological advances in different countries and societies, or developing technology to bridge cultural boundaries in an effort to support more effective collaborative work.
Our teaching, too, touches upon the global nature of information technology, for instance discussing why certain games are more popular in some cultures than others, or addressing the fact that much of today’s software is typically developed by a global team that may never meet in person.
Given this, it should come as no surprise that we value an international student body. The experiences, perspectives, opinions, and ideas that different students bring to the table are of crucial importance in deepening our research and our teaching.
If you are an international student interested in joining us, the campus maintains some excellent resources for prospective international students, both for undergraduate students and graduate students.
A reunion of students from some of our past project 191 teams.
