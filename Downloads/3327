    				Sharing your photos: Animoto    			


There are many sites that are apprring with new twists on sharing your photos.  I am seeing so many that I will start mentioning some of them briefly here.  A problem is that many of these are still in closed beta so I may mention them without much experience with them.  In any case, if you are interested in sharing photos, you will find these sites interesting.
Animoto.com allows you to prepare a video of the photos that you take using your iPhone, hopefully other similar devices soon, using your favorite music — right on your phone — and send it to friends or post it.
It has a business model that allows you to use free service for occassional use, but you could become a premier user or a business user if you want to use it regularly.
