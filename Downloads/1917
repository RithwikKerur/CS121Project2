Backup and Restore

This page has some background information on making backups and explains some basic *nix backup and restore procedures.

Introduction
Your wiki installation contains some unique data in the following directories:

    local/         Local configuration scripts
    cookbook/      Recipes obtained from the Cookbook
    pub/           Publicly accessible files
    wiki.d/        Wiki pages
    uploads/       Uploaded files (attachments)
A good backup plan will include periodically archiving these directories â€” or at bare minimum local/ and wiki.d/.  Good practice dictates keeping your backup archives on a separate machine.

Simple Backup and Restore (*nix)
When it comes to backup, simpler is better.  
Since the pmwiki distribution is very small (about 1/4 megabyte), it's simplest to just archive the distribution files along with the data.

Making a Backup Archive
The following *nix command, executed from the parent directory of your wiki's directory, will put a complete backup archive of your site in your home directory.


tar -zcvf  ~/wiki-backup-`date +%Y%m`.tar.gz  wiki/


Restoring the Backup Archive
Simple Method
Your site can be restored and running in under 30 seconds with


tar -zxvf ~/wiki-backup-200512.tar.gz
find wiki/uploads/ -type d |xargs chmod 777
find wiki/wiki.d/ -type d |xargs chmod 777

A Slightly-More-Secure Method
The simple restore commands above will give you world-writable files and directories.  You can avoid world-writable permissions by letting PmWiki create directories with the proper attributes (ownership and permissions) for you.

Start with


tar -zxvf ~/wiki-backup-200512.tar.gz
rm -rf wiki/wiki.d
rm -rf uploads
chmod 2777 wiki/

Now upload a file in each group that had uploads.  If your site doesn't have uploads, just visit your site once so the wiki.d/ directory will be created.

Finish your installation with


chmod 755 wiki/
tar -zxvf ~/wiki-backup-200512.tar.gz

Details
The commands on this page assume your site is in a directory called "wiki/".  The test backup was made in December, 2005 so it's named accordingly.

Your site will only have an uploads/ directory if uploads are enabled.

The backup command uses a date stamp (YYYYMM) in the filename.  If you automate the command via cron you'll wind up with monthly snapshots of your site.  You can get a daily snapshot by appending %d to the date command (`date +%Y%m%d` will get you YYYYMMDD).  Be wary of space limitations if you have a large uploads/ directory.

Miscellaneous
Backup via FTP
Download and install a ftp client like Filezilla

Using the ftp client connect to the server where you host pmWiki using
the IP address (ex: 123.234.56.67) or the ftp name (ex: ftp.myhost.com)
supply your account name (ex: mylogin) and password (ex: myp4ssw0rd)
Move to your pmWiki directory (ex: /usr/mylogin/web/wiki/ or /tahi/public_html/pmwiki )
Select the folder you want to backup as explained before (probably either only the data or the whole wiki directory)
for data you will want to backup both the directories
wiki.d for user page data
pmwikiuploads (or uploads) for your attachments (uploads)
for system you will want, at a minimum, to backup both the directories
local for configuration data 
pub for local CSS and skins customisations
Download them to a local folder
Use 7zip or a similar software to build an archive of this backup
You can also very easily sync your FTP directories with your hard disc via this command line:
  wget -nv -np -m ftp://user:password@ftp.yourhost.net/ 
Download Wget for Windows (other systems normally have it installed).

Alternatively, you can also mirror your FTP directories with lftp:
 lftp -u your_user_name,your_password -e "mirror --verbose  /wiki.d /path/to/local/folder" ftp://your_host 
(this will mirror only the /wiki.d folder, replace with / to mirror everything)
