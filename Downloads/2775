    				Shortage of Internet Media Companies!!    			


NYT article comments on the shortage of Internet Media companies (!!):
digital-era media companies like Yahoo and Google, as well as traditional media companies, including those with deep roots in television and print, continue to scour the Internet for emerging content and technology companies. But the pickings of obvious acquisition candidates, while hardly exhausted, are slimming, according to financiers, entrepreneurs and industry analysts who follow the sector. 
I am surprised by this article.

I agree that the pickings for large media companies is slim but there are lots of great little ones that would be great acquisitions.
