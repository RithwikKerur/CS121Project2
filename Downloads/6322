Rohith Reddy Gangam

	I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine. My area of study is theoretical computer science and my research is focussed on algorithmic game theory and related disciplines. I am honored to be advised by Prof. Vijay Vazirani and Prof. Milena Mihail.

	

	Before coming to UCI, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from  Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I worked at Goldman Sachs for a while before joining Machine Learning Lab at IIIT Hyderabad to work as a Research Assistant with  Prof. Sujit Gujar.
