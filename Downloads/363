Playful Fabrication & Augmenting Reality for Augmented Reality 















We’re creating games and other entertainment applications to be played using 3D printers and other small-scale fabrication systems in order to produce new contexts for hardware innovation, and to better understand use-cases that can drive widespread adoption of these technologies.How does the design of fabrication hardware change when used as a communication device, or a device for play, instead of as a tool for prototyping? We’re also creating microscale architectures (dollhouses, physical models, etc.) to envision a future where pervasive augmented reality technology has reshaped our physical environment. What does the world look like when it knows that a computer is looking at it? How can we create richer AR experiences when the designed environment has elements that originated in a digital system?Associated ProjectsTerraForm: a 3D printed strategy gameRestless: The Haunted DollhouseAssociated Publications2013 CHI Paper: Democratizing Technology: Pleasure, Utility and Expressiveness in DIY and Maker Practice2013 CHI Workshop Paper: Fabrication as Syndication: 3D Printing, Communication, and Narrative2015 Book Chapter: Fabricating Futures:Envisioning Scenarios for Home Fabrication Technology2016 DIS Workshop: Digital Craftsmanship: HCI Takes on Technology as an Expressive Medium2016 DiGRA Talk: Playful Fabrication: Speculative Game Designs for 3D Printers2017 Book Chapter: Speculative Prototyping: Making Plastic Printing Sustainable and Playful2017 Interactions Article: Augmenting Reality for Augmented Reality
