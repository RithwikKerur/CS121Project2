Graduate Student Spotlight: Ernest Garrison Finds Joy in Helping Others

September 19, 2019


One of the newest graduate students in the Department of Informatics is a familiar face in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). Prior to joining the Ph.D. program this fall, Ernest Garrison was assistant director of the Office of Access and Inclusion (OAI), working tirelessly to recruit and support students who are underrepresented in engineering and information and computer sciences. Now Garrison — himself a first-generation college student — is ready to transition from staff back to student. Here, he talks about his work for OAI, the journey from his hometown of Detroit to UCI, and how the Great Recession of 2008 and a summer algebra class in 2016 helped him find his calling.

Professor Gloria Mark Awarded Collaborative NSF Future of Work Grant




The future of teamwork will require the integration of technological advances to facilitate team performance, yet we are largely relying on tools and techniques from the 20th century for team facilitation. This is the problem to be addressed in a new National Science Foundation (NSF) collaborative grant awarded to Informatics Professor Gloria Mark in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program, under which the grant is awarded, is one of the NSF’s 10 Big Ideas.

Forbes: “‘Robots And Algorithms And AI, Oh My!’ Careers Scholar Gina Dokko’s Take On What They All Mean” (Melissa Mazmanian mentioned)

September 3, 2019


Gina Dokko is a University of California Davis, career scholar who chaired a panel titled “Robots And Algorithms And AI, Oh My!” at a recent meeting of the Academy of Management. The panel involved three more scholars, a business school dean, a writer on work and technology (UCI’s Melissa Mazmanian), and a job market analytics CEO. Their charge was to look beyond the short-term advice commonly available, and to ask a series of deeper questions: “What do these technologies mean for careers? What does a good career look like now? How can people starting their careers prepare for a lifetime of work? How do people in the middle of their careers proceed along career paths that are shifting or buckling?”
