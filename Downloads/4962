Project ideas should be finalized by now! Come to the meeting with your group to make sure your topics are set and get ready to start building your websites. Don’t forget to bring your laptops, FOOD will be provided!
Don’t forget to RSVP on Facebook! Be sure that you are updated with the PowerPoint slides and everything is good to go(if not, make sure to ask during this meeting) so we can start coding websites in HTML!
