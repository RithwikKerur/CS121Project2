    				Cameras will recognize you    			


Now that face detection technology has become kind of common in digital cameras, no wonder that people have started thinking about cameras with face recognition.  An interesting piece on this was posted by Stephen Shankland.
Face recognition is definitely much more difficult than face detection.  Considering that in most cases a particular user may be using her camera to take pictures — one can again use context.  In most cases, 90-10 rule will apply — which in this context may mean that 90% faces in pictures may belong to about 10 people.  Once again context may come to rescue and one may start annotating pictures automatically using such ‘limited’ recognition.
