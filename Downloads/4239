December 10,  2013ACM Press Room2013 Fellows Hail from World's Leading Universities and Corporations
Read the story below or view it on the 
ACM website.
NEW YORK, December 10, 2013 -- ACM has recognized 50 of its members for their contributions to computing that are driving innovations across multiple domains and disciplines.  The 2013 ACM Fellows,  from the world’s leading universities, corporations, and research labs, have achieved advances in computing research and development that are accelerating the digital revolution and impacting every dimension of how we live, work, and play... worldwide.  
ACM President Vinton G. Cerf celebrated the impact of innovations achieved by this year’s ACM Fellows. “We recognize these scientists and engineers, creators and builders, theorists and practitioners who are making a difference in our lives,” he said.  “They’re enabling us to listen, learn, calculate, and communicate in ways that underscore the benefits of the digital age.  Their advances have led to opportunities for improved healthcare, enhanced security, expanded interactions, and enriched lifestyles.  Some recipients have also led efforts to extend computing across continents and countries including Brazil, China, and Germany.”
Within the corporate sector, the 2013 ACM Fellows named from IBM Research were cited for contributions to knowledge discovery and data mining, and for leadership in probabilistic methods for data and system simulation management and analysis.  Raytheon BBN Technologies’ ACM Fellow was recognized for contributions to quantum communications, advanced networks, and programming literacy.  Liquid Robotics’ ACM Fellow was cited for contributions to programming languages, tools, and environments.  Boeing’s ACM Fellow was honored for achievements in computer graphics, user interaction, and visual analytics.  Other companies with 2013 ACM Fellows are Yahoo!, Google Inc., and Microsoft Research. Their respective contributions include industrial leadership and information retrieval; cryptography in systems security and privacy; and computer vision and multimedia.
 Among the universities with 2013 ACM Fellows is the University of California, with representatives from San Diego, Berkeley, Irvine, and Los Angeles campuses.  These Fellows were recognized for achievements in security methods for high-quality cryptography; software reliability and quality; information retrieval and computational linguistics, and algorithms for graph partitioning and commodity flows; foundations of automated reasoning and approaches to data mining and machine learning; and research on human interactions with information systems and data practices.  Cornell University’s ACM Fellows were honored for contributions to the science of information and social networks; languages and systems for implementing secure computing systems; and design and analysis of approximation algorithms.  At the University of Maryland, ACM Fellows were recognized for image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition; and automated search and planning.  The ACM Fellows at Massachusetts Institute of Technology were cited for wireless networking and Internet congestion control, and synchronization in concurrent programming.  The University of Pennsylvania’s ACM Fellows were recognized for algorithmic approaches to program reliability and bioinformatics;  query languages and optimization, and data provenance. 
Other North American universities with 2013 ACM Fellows include University of Michigan; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Duke University; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Rochester; Texas A&M University; State University of New York Oswego; Stanford University; Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and Virginia Polytechnic Institute; Rice University; Harvard University; New York University Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences; University of Southern California; Georgia Institute of Technology; and University of Texas, Austin.  ACM Fellows from these institutions were cited respectively for achievements in human computer interaction; multiprocessor and multicore real-time systems; sensor network infrastructure optimization; computer vision; software architecture; artificial intelligence for assistive technology; wireless communication and control; software for concurrency; natural language processing; high performance computing algorithms; parallel and high performance computing; verification of practical programming languages; data management; teamwork and security games; network communication and computation; and randomness and complexity theory.   
Among universities outside of North America, the 2013 ACM Fellows hailed from University College London; Politecnico di Milano; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro; Peking University; RWTH Aachen University, Germany; ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), RMIT University, Australia; Seoul National University; and National University of Singapore.  Fellows from these universities were recognized respectively for achievements in computer vision and image retrieval, and information retrieval theory and practice; database management; software engineering; video technology; conceptual modeling; operating systems and networking research; database query optimization; scalable data mining and query processing; and computational biology.  
ACM will formally recognize the 2013 Fellows at its annual Awards Banquet on June 21, 2014, in San Francisco. Additional information about the ACM 2013 Fellows, as well as previous ACM Fellows and award winners is available on the ACM Awards site.
