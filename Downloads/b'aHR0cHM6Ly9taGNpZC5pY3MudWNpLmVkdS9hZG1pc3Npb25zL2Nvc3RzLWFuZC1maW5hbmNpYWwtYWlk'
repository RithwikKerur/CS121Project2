Costs and Financial Aid


The newly revised amounts for the 2021-2022 academic year will be posted in late summer and can be found on the Registrar’s website. The listed fees include all costs for the program, except air, ground, or rail transportation required to attend the in person sessions and books. The MHCID is a one-year program. Fees are subject to change, both before students enroll and during a student’s enrollment. UC Irvine bills for fees each quarter. Fees are paid in four equal installments at the beginning of each quarter of the program. Fees include software and local travel expenses (e.g., hotels, meals in Orange County) for the accelerated courses. Fees do not include other living expenses, student health insurance, or specific campus-based fees (e.g., student recreation center). Please note that the MHCID is a self-supporting degree program; thus, certain fee waivers traditionally accepted by the University of California may not be accepted. For example, we do not accept Calvet Waivers nor is there a discount for “in-state” students. However, all students will be eligible for financial aid.
Please note “Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 21-22 may be delivered remotely. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.”
Additionally, we offer a variety of merit-based scholarships, including our “20 for 20” program, a scholarship in the amount of 20% of total program fees for the top 20% of each admitted cohort. All students who apply for the program will also be considered for scholarships. No supplemental materials are required for consideration.
