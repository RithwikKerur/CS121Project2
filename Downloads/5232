Winter 2021 Week 10: WICSdoro Study Night 

 03/10/202104/23/2021admin



On Monday, March 8th 2021, WICS organized a pomodoro-style study night to help close off this stressful quarter! During our Zoom meeting, participants were able to choose the rooms that corresponded to the classes that they were studying for. Every group had their own breakout room, where the participants studied together and kept each other accountable for the 25-minute study sessions. After each study session, participants had a 15-minute break to relax, bond with other students, and play games like Sketchful, Werewolf, Spyfall, Codenames, and jigsaw puzzles! Over 40 students attended our final winter quarter meeting to study together, and we hope that your efforts will pay off!
