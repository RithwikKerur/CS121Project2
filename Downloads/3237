    				Allergic reaction    			


I knew that I was allergic to Iodine dye in CT scans.  I was not aware, however, that this could happen in many different ways.
On 19th May when I looked at my bandages, I found that there was rash as some reaction.  I contacted Dr Warden who suspected that something has caused this reaction but he could not guess what.  In any case, he wanted to see it and after seeing it he sent me to a dermatologist.  The reaction has resulted in all reddish skin around the area where I had the immobilizer.  Now I am now suppose to use any bandage or immobilizer — just use extra strength Cortizone to take care of this rash.
I was thinking that everything was progressing well, but suddenly this problem came up — to delay the recovery.
