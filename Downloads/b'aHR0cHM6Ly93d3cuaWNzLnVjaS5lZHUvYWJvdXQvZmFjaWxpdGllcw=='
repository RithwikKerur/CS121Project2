Facilities

Donald Bren Hall Conference Center (DBH 6011)

Seating capacity: 72 with tables or 150 lecture-style seating
Recommended for groups of 50 or more
Optional catering kitchen and rooftop patio

The Bren Hall Conference Center and Patio area may be reserved for meetings (administrative, research, industrial partners, colloquia, distinguished speakers, etc.) and are to be used primarily for Bren School of ICS functions. These facilities may NOT be used for regularly scheduled classes and courses.
Reservations are on a first-come first-served basis. ICS Dean’s events take precedence over any and all other reservations. The Conference Center is to be used primarily for large groups (50 or more). In addition to DBH 6011, users may reserve the Catering Kitchen and 6th floor Patio.
Room users must sign a Usage Contract, taking responsibility for the proper use and care of the facility. All users agree to abide by the terms and conditions for use, and no “room reservation” exists unless a completed/signed contract has been delivered to and accepted by the ICS Facilities Office.

Building card keys are required to access the room during off-hours and weekends. Room is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Users may reserve a time by filling in the sign-in sheet posted outside of the room. The room can be locked from the inside when occupied.
