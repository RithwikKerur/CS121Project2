    				Sharing your photos: Orsiso    			


Orsiso.com wants to help you in organizing and simplifying your socially networked life.  You can aggregate and pull information, inclusing phot albums, from multiple sites and have a unified access at one place.  This company is also in private beta but a cute avatar explains the mission of the company.  Also, Neil showed me the system — he is one of those in private beta — and I found it very well designed — particularly in terms of presenting the information collected from various sites.
