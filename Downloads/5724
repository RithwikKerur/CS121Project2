Lecture Twelve--ICS 131--Fall
00--2 Nov 2000
Review of lecture 11--Computers and Health Care
Great (if not greatest) Need
Potential for great good, great harm
Need to control cost
Potential ease of applications ???
Progress to date is modest
Why hasn't more been done?
Money
If money, spend it on devices
Other (overwhelming) problems in health care
Privacy concerns
Need to change system, e.g., preventative care

Software Safety
Readings:
Shiver, Jube, Jr. FAA Software Flaw Spotlights Malady of Digital
Age,
LA Times, 27 Oct 00, C1, C10
Leveson, Nancy, and Turner, Clark S. An investigation of the Therac-25
Accidents, IEEE Computer, July 1993, 18-41. [Use Google to get to Leveson,
Nancy web page]
1. Software in critical applications
    One thing to have problems in productivity software
    Quite another to have problems in software controlling
life-critical applications
 

2. Two examples
    A. Air traffic control
"The glitch in Palmdale that delayed air traffic
is blamed on coding and on insufficient testing and controller training."
"A lone air traffic controller, sitting in the darkened confines
of the
    Palmdale Air Route Traffic Control Center,
    innocently shut down much of the air traffic
across
    the Southwest last week be merely typing a a
    few too many characters on his computer."
entered 9 characters to represent a Mexican flight
system could only handle five characters
Problems--
    inadequate testing,
inadequate training on new system
inadequate training on old system
aggravated by shift problems
Software customized for each air hub
 -------------------------------------------------
B. Therac 25
A device used to provide radiation treatment
for cancer patients
Six cases where the device malfunctioned and
provided significant overdoses of radiation
causing deaths and injuries
Problems--four contributing factors
Management inadequacies and lack of procedures
for following through on all reported incidents
overconfidence in the software and
removal of hardware interlocks
(making the sofware into a single point of failure
that could lead to an accident)
presumably less-than-acceptable
software-engineering practices
unrealistic risk assessment along with overconfidence
in the results of these assessments.
 
3. What can be done?
a. Who's at fault?
b. Understanding "accident"
"Most accidents are system accidents; that is, they stem from complex
interactions between various components and activities. To attribute a
single cause to an accident is usually a serious mistake. In this article,
we hope to demonstrate the complex nature of accidents and the need to
investigate all aspects of system development and operation to understand
what has happened and to prevent future accidents." page 1
c. Don't trust software, i.e., rely solely on the software
d. The interface issue
e. System engineering issues
f. Sofware engineering issues
"documentation should not be an afterthought
software quality assurance practices and standards should be established
designs should be kept simple
ways to get information about errors--for example software audit
trails-- should be designed into the software from the beginning
the software whould be subjected to extensive testing and formal
analysis
at the module and software level; system testing alone is not adequate"
g. Role of government
licensing
review, testing
h. Role of educational institutions
