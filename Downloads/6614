Research Interests



George Lueker's interests are in the area of the design and analysis
of algorithms for concrete problems.  Lueker is especially interested
in applications of probability to problems in computer science,
in particular
the analysis of the behavior of algorithms and optimization
problems when some assumption is made about the probability
distribution of inputs.  For example, he has investigated the behavior
of the optimum solution to the bin-packing problem and the partition
problem.  With graduate
student Mariko Molodowitch he developed a remarkably simple proof of
the result that the probabilistic behavior of double hashing is
asymptotically equivalent to that of the theoretically ideal uniform
hashing, for fixed load factors arbitrarily close to one.
He has also investigated improved bounds on the expected length of the longest
common subsequence when the input strings are random.
