    				Entrepreneurship and Processes    			


News.com has an interview of Fake, the co-founder of Flickr, which has many interesting points for entrepreneurs.Â  One of the most important point that I liked was:
There are tons of amazing ideas in big companies, and no innovation deficit. But the obstacle to getting things built is mostly process. There is one kind of process developed for building and maintaining large-scale products, like Yahoo Mail. And the development processes for that are very different from what it takes to build a new product in a short amount of time.
