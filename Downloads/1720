Classes-2008F /
Announcements


10/22/08 - Drew
I'm just creating this page to test the waters -- if people aren't interested, that's fine.  The idea is that you can post announcements or progress reports here, and people will see them because they've subscribed to the RSS feed for this page (http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Classes-2008F/Announcements?action=rss).

Oops.  Apparently RSS feeds aren't enabled on this PMWiki installation, so nevermind. =]
