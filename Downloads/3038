    				India has more than 200 Million Telephone subscribers    			


According to InfoworldÂ  India has now more than 200 miliion telephone subscribers.Â  In 2006 the number increased 47.6% — yes that is right.
So India must now be the third largest — after China and US — and may soon overtake US also in number of subscribers.Â  A great opportunity for interesting businesses.Â  But one also needs interesting business models because more than 50% (if not 70%) subscribers are prepaid.

Well said Rajesh,
In fact, though the numbers are huge, the per user spending capacity is what that will decide the actual potential of this market. India has a peculiar market as of now with a large prepaid market, and very less premium users. But the time is ripe for big players to come in, although the call tariff is at a flat low rate these days.
The more the merrier!
Best,
Mani

That’s right, India and China will both overtake the U.S.A, it’s just a matter of time.
