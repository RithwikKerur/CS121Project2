Lecture Eleven--ICS 131--Fall 00--31 October 2000

Review of Lecture Ten

About half of U.S. adults are on-line
Of the half not on-line, many don't want to be
Impact of age, gender, race, ethnicity, income, rural-urban
Why don't you want to be on-line?


Dangerous, expensive, confusing, not missing anything
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Computers and Health Care
 Not AI, Bio technology
	As an Electronic Commerce application
	More mundane applications of computers
Greatest Need
	Maybe of all possible applications of IT
	Why?
		Life critical business
		Errors can cause death or injury
		Need for best care
		Relieve pain
		Financial issues
			rising health care costs
		Lack of equity in access
		Medical record availability
		Billing problems
Modest progress
	E-mail--some M.D.'s
	Lab reports--text only--no graphics at UCIMC
	No Rx transmitted to pharmacy electronically--UCIMC
	No remote access to lab reports for UCIMC
	Appts on web at UCIMC???
	Some M.D. information on UCIMC web site
	Information on web on diseases and treatment
Why is the situation what it is?

	Money is short
	Not sure what to do
	Other problems more important, e.g., UCIMC
	Mergers, take overs
	Don't cost patient time
	Money for high-tech gadgets
	Multiple files
	Privacy concerns
	.com problems
	resistance to change
	don't want to give up money generating care
	hard to convert to preventative care
What can be done?
	access to on-line info for doctors
	drug interactions, side effects
