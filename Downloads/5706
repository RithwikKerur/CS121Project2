Lecture 10--ICS 131--Winter
2000--9 Feb 2000
From Computer Assisted Instruction
to Distance Learning
 
A. What was Ralph Gerard's
Dream for UCI?
B. What really happened?
The good, and the not-so-good
C. What's happening now in
The World and UCI?
D. What would a distance
learning
version of 131 look like?
------------------------------------------------------
Two things Feldman left
out
A. Computer based toys as
teaching devices
Lego, Intel-Mattel
B. Instructional material
for young children
One thing Feldman underplayed
Distance learning for organizations
--------------------------------------------------------------
Comparing Distance learning
and e-mail
e-mail was an unexpected
consequence
of establishing networks
and a rousing success
distance learning and CAI
were expected to be
big winners in the computer
business
(and that may still happen)
but maybe not
in conventional educations
institutions
(What is the future of
conventional educational
institutions?)

 ----------------------------------------------------
I. "Toward an Ethics and
Etiquette
for Electronic Mail"
Shapiro and Anderson, RAND
1985
A. Is E-Mail different
than other forms of communication?
1. Some general considerations
Probably not that much different
from
real letters and memos
i.e., no visual cues, no
interruptions
Clearly different from face-to-face
e.g., JF's bank experience
in Jerusalem
Compare to telephone conversation
--can interrupt, tone of
voice
2. Speed
How long to make a connection?
Is somebody expecting your
message?
Transmission speed
Comparison media
letter mail, telephone, face-to-face
 
3. Permanence
e-mail has appearance of
being temporary,
but it is really permanent
"Never say anything in an
electronic message
that you wouldn't want
appearing and attributed
to you
in tomorrow morning's front-page
headline in the New York
Times."
4. Cost of distribution
Our comparison three:
getting a letter typed, stamp
travel cost
telephone call cost
5. Organization's ability
to control the medium
Pretty good on e-mail, especially
post-audit
Copies of letter to boss
---------------------------------------------------------------
B. Sending
1. Keep messages simple
One subject
Few recipients
Identify yourself
2. Stick to the facts
Label opinions as such
Label emotions as such
3. Assume message will be
on "front page..."
Don't insult or criticize
Don't send the message
-------------------------------------------------------
C. Receiving and Responding
1. Emotions
Count to 10
Look again
2. Opinions
Separate opinions from facts
so you can respond appropriately
3. Sender, consider the
Assume honest and competent
Maybe don't respond to some
things
Courtesy to, e.g., you receive
a message
not intended for you
------------------------------------------------------------------
II. "Computers, Networks,
and Work"
Sproull and Kiesler
Scientific American, 1995
A. Network groups talked
more frankly, more equally
Why frankly? Other cases,
drug use, liquor consumption
Why equally?
Less inhibitions than in
face-to-face
Some dangers in not knowing
who is on the other end of
the line
 

B. Network groups generated
more ideas
no interruptions
open atmosphere
everybody getting into the
act
 
C. Take longer to make a
decision
consistent with other characteristics
 
D. More flaming
have to flame to be heard
nobody to hold you down
 
III. E-mail experiences
A. Grinter's talk on Lucent
Distributed organization
24 hour work day
acquisitions
low labor cost
B. JF's experiences
1. Healthcare Facilitator
Advisory Board
Get some exchanges in face-to-face
Not much in e-mail
2. Survey of High-Option
Annuitants
OP draft
Comments by JF and SM
How communicated to OP?
Result--survey
Result--action
3. Annuitants comments on
bid process
Ask for comments
Bundle them up and ship them
off
Did e-mail encourage this
strategy?
