Fall Quarter 2017 Week 0: WICS Social 

 09/30/201711/08/2017Diana Sandil



On Thursday, September 28th, WICS had their very first week 0 social. The event was located in the common room of the Berkeley Court Clubhouse, so there had to be walk groups from the flagpoles to the location so no one would get lost. The social was meant for WICS members (new and old) to get to know each other and socialize. More people came than expected (about 65 people came total), so some adjustments had to be made with the snacks. Besides some of the initial difficulties with having enough for all 65 people to eat, everyone seemed to be having a great time with lots of great conversation.
