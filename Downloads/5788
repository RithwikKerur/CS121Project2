Education Week: “No, Fortnite Isn’t Rotting Kids’ Brains. It May Even Be Good for Them” by Kurt Squire

November 29, 2018


Some researchers have said that parents and teachers shouldn’t worry the violence in Fortnite will lead to violent behavior by players. Kurt Squire, a professor of social informatics at the University of California Irvine, wrote in an Education Week Commentary that research shows there is no causal link. He said Fortnite isn’t all that different from “traditional types of kids’ play,” like tag or capture the flag.

Ph.D. Students Du, Meza Soria Take Second Place at AMIA Student Design Challenge




Tasked with “leveraging interactive technologies to deliver care outside of traditional care settings — anytime, anywhere,” third-year informatics Ph.D. student Yao Du and second-year software engineering Ph.D. student Adriana Meza Soria rose to the challenge. Together, they entered the Sixth Annual Student Design Challenge (SDC), held at the 2018 Annual Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and were among the three finalists asked to give oral presentations. They ended up taking second place for their proposal, “Designing Conversational Agents to Support Home Exercises for Children Who Receive Speech and Language Therapy.”

Huffington Post: “On Maid-Rating Apps India’s Entitled Baba-Log Hit New Low” (PhD candidate Noopur Raval quoted)

November 19, 2018


Having an app that rates these domestic workers only makes the problem worse, explained Noopur Raval, a PhD candidate in Informatics at the University of California, Irvine …. “People tend to rate and give feedback only in extreme experiences—bad or good. There is also a rating bias because users have previously trained on rating systems for Amazon. Yelp etc. So a 5-star or equivalent does not mean the same thing in each platform and this affects workers too.”

Professor Black Discusses Technology Behind UCI’s $14.7M Grant to Expand Literacy Outreach




UCI was recently awarded a $14.7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to expand its literacy outreach project, Pathway to Academic Success, which has improved student outcomes for English learners in 10 Southern California school districts. The grant aims to extend the program to 109,200 middle- and high-school students in Arizona, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, Texas and Wisconsin. As reported in October, “the multiyear professional development program for teachers promotes an instructional approach to enhance the thinking tools that research indicates students use to understand, interpret and write analytical essays about nonfiction texts.”

Professor Branham Highlights “Interdependence” for Assistive Technology in Award-Winning Paper

November 2, 2018


Back when Assistant Professor of Informatics Stacy Branham was a still postdoc, her first research paper focused on how blind and sighted partners work together to make their homes mutually accessible. She had originally discussed both “independence” and “interdependence” in the home, but the section on interdependence did not make the final cut for 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. However, at that CHI 2015 conference, Branham concluded her paper presentation by saying that the challenge going forward would be to “design toward interdependence.”

Buzzfeed: “Multitasking Is Bad, And You Really Shouldn’t Do It” (Gloria Mark quoted)

October 26, 2018


Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at UC Irvine, told me that people check their email an average of 74 times a day. Our email demands our attention. It makes our phone buzz, it makes a little (1) icon pop up that is impossible to ignore, it more or less stomps its feet and throws a fit until we pay attention to it. That’s fertile ground for stress. “We’ve done a study that looks at the start and stop time of when people are on email, and then looks at stress measurements created by heart rate monitors,” Mark said. “We find that the longer time people spend on email, the higher their stress.”
