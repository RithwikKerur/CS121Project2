Call for Participation:Community Organizing for Datafied Worlds
We are interested in understanding how community organizers use data to pursue grassroots-led projects and to influence broader uses of data-intensive technologies by and for working-class communities of color.
If you identify as a community organizer, you are eligible to participate in this study. If you are interested in participating in the study, please fill out this 5-question recruitment survey to confirm you are eligible to participate. We will reach out to eligible participants with next steps.
If you participate in the study, you will be asked to fill out a pre-interview survey. This pre-interview survey will cover basic demographic questions and the particulars of your work as a community organizer. It should take around 15 minutes to complete. After you submit the pre-interview survey, the project team will get in touch with you to schedule a 60-90 minute interview either in person or via Zoom. Your total time commitment should be between one and two hours.
If you accept the invitation to participate in the study, we remind you that your participation in this research will be voluntary and confidential. You will have the right to review your responses and withdraw consent at any point during the study. After you have completed the interview, you will receive $100 in cash (or Venmo) for your participation.Dr. Roderic N.
