Example 4 - Multivariate Data






Example 4 – Representing Multivariate Data
 
Choose a thing that has lots of instances with several
attributes that is common for people to search or find a relationship in. The
example I used in class was that of tea. There are thousands of types of teas
with many attributes. Some attributes are quantitative (e.g. water temperature
and steep time) and some are qualitative (e.g. “smooth” and “flavorful”). You
may choose another example. 
 
Sketch out and explain in a short paragraph, a visualization
that would help a viewer choose among the many instances to find something they
were searching for (a pattern, a single instance, etc.). 
 
The sketch does not have to be complete nor programmed. For
instance, if you use pen and paper, you can scan the image to include it in a
document. Your explanation can describe any missing details. 
 
Your explanation should include a statement whether you
think the search task is better accomplished with a non visual interface and
why. 
 
Use your imagination.
