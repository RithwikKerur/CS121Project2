Fall 2020 Week 7: Get Involved With Undergraduate Research 

 11/21/202004/23/2021admin



On Thursday, 19th November, 2020, WICS conducted a Research Information session with Professor Wayne Hayes. Professor Wayne Hayes shared about the research projects that he’s leading from image analysis of cells to graph theory’s relation to biological networks to image analysis of spiral galaxies. Many of his students have gone on to graduate school and even published prestigious scientific articles! There was also a question-answer suggestion conducted with students who are involved in research. This event definitely opened doors to countless research opportunities in the future.
