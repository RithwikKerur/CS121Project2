About Me



			I was a PhD student in Prof. Rina Dechter’s Automated Reasoning group.  I am currently a Software Engineer at Google working on Personal Data Infrastructure.
			

			I successfully defended my thesis, titled "Advancing Heuristics for Search over Graphical Models", in March 2017, submitted the final version in May 2017, and officially received my degree in June 2017.
			

			The main contributions of my graduate work included improvements over state-of-the-art heuristics used within the AND/OR search framework to extend the reach of search algorithms for both exact and anytime MPE inference.  I also explored the AND/OR Decision Diagram framework, using it to performing exact inference on high treewidth problems with problem specific structures such as determinism and context-specific independence.



Before UC Irvine, I was an undergraduate research assistant in R-LAIR (Riverside Lab for Artificial Intelligence Research) with Prof. Christian Shelton at UC Riverside.I worked on the CTBN-RLE code base. Specifically, I implemented the structure learning component, which learns Bayesian network and continuous time Bayesian network structures from trajectory data.  It seamlessly incorporates any of the inference methods available in CTBN-RLE to handle the case of partially observed trajectories through structural EM.  I also implemented the mean field variational inference algorithm inside CTBN-RLE.
