    				Social Networks on Mobile by Coke!    			


Yes, CocaCola wants to launch a mobile social network to attract young audience.Â  more details at http://news.com.com/Cokes+new+fizz+a+mobile+social+network/2100-1024_3-6189329.html?tag=html.alert.hedÂ .
Just yesterday after my India trip I had started thinking about this more as a result of Rajesh’s enthusiasm about MyToday’ and its relevance to mobile phones in India.Â  As this piece says
Eyeing the success of mostly desktop computer-bound teen social sites, Coca-Cola said Wednesday it is creating a cell-phone network under its Sprite brand where members can set up profiles, post pictures and meet new friends.
I think that mobile social networks could be very interesting and may be far reaching.

I agree with you. Not only internet is on your fridge, your cellphone, your coffee machine, it’s crazy…but interesting.
