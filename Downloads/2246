Cambium-Organism Translator


This translator produces model files for the Organism simulator, from a 
model expressed in the Organism namespace of the Cambium intermediate 
process language.  

The translation is performed using Mathematica transformation 
rules in order to provide explicit syntactic transformations.  
Cambium translations for other modeling languages could also be 
implemented with a standard procedural program.



Usage


Within Mathematica, the Cambium model can be transformed to a 
text string using the translator, and then written to a text file:

	translatedModel = cambiumModel /. TranslateCambiumToOrganism
	fstr = OpenWrite["example.model"];
	Write[fstr, OutputForm[translatedModel]];
	Close[fstr];
