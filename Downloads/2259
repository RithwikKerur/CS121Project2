Research Areas



AI and Machine Learning with particular emphasis on: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and their Theoretical Foundations and
Applications.
Applications, particularly in the Natural Sciences:

Physics (High-Energy Physics, Cosmology, Quantum Mechanics);
Chemistry (Prediction of Molecular Properties, Prediction of Chemical Reactions, Drug Discovery, Chemoinformatics);
Biology (Neuroscience, Circadian Rhythms, Gene Regulation,  Omic Sciences, Protein Structure Prediction, Bioinformatics, Systems Biology).





		The driving interest behind my efforts is to understand natural and artificial intelligence.
		
 New book: 
		Deep Learning in Science
