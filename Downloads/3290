    				MIR at IEEE Int Conf on Image Processing    			


I  am attending a workshop on Multimedia Information Retrieval at ICIP 2008 in San Diego.  Interesting place to have this workshop — ICIP deals with more signal processing oriented image processing so MIR seems a bit out of place.  But this workshop is very well attended.  
I was requested to give the first talk at this workshop.  I talked about Personal Media Management.  My presentation is available here under presentations.
