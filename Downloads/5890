Graduate Student Policies: Advancing to Candidacy

Advancing to Candidacy for the M.S. Degree

The advancement exam is an oral presentation to a five-member committee of senate faculty. Note that you may combine your Ph.D. advancement with your topic defense with the consent of your advisor. The committee must be composed of the Committee Chair, three general members, and one outside member. The Chair of the candidacy commitee must hold either a primary or joint appointment in the student's department, and the majority of the committee must be from the student's department. The outside member must be a UC Irvine faculty member and may not be affiliated with the student's department.
Each committee member must agree on the research you would like to complete for your doctoral dissertation.
