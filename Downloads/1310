Dulcimania




Dulcimania "Mostly Celtic music, mostly on hammered
dulcimer" 
Dulcimania is Barbara Gershman, Norm Jacobson and Brad Moore, playing for about 25 years around Southern California at public venues and private functions,
most notably at every-other-month gigs at Alta Coffee House in Newport Beach.
Barbara and Norm have each won prizes at Claremont's Hammer Dulcimer Championship competitions and been featured guests on the KSBR radio program Folks Roots. Brad is well known around Orange County for his fiddle, mandolin and tenor banjo playing.
Dulcimania builds its arrangements around the 

hammered dulcimer, concentrating on traditional Celtic music and new compositions
in the traditional style.
