About ICS


By establishing the University of California's first computer science school in 2002, UC Irvine made an investment in the future that reflects its historical commitment to raising the bar of excellence.
From pioneering computer science courses more than three decades ago to the creation of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), UCI continues to be an institute that leads information technology education and research across the globe.
ICS began as a department in 1968. More than 35 years later, it was formally recognized as a school — and in June 2004, the School adopted benefactor Donald Bren's name in recognition of his generous contribution and visionary leadership.
As an independent school focused solely on the computer and information sciences, ICS has a unique perspective on the information technology disciplines that allows us a broad foundation from which to build educational programs and research initiatives that explore the many applications of the computing discipline — from circuits and systems to software engineering and human aspects of computing.
Building on our strong foundation of computer science fundamentals, ICS conducts cutting-edge research in strategic areas ideal for collaborative work.
By blending research with education in multiple disciplines, the Bren School is leading interdisciplinary efforts in order to meet the challenges of the future.
Our Mission
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences aims for excellence in research and education.
Our mission is to lead the innovation of new information and computing technology by fundamental research in the core areas of information and computer sciences and cultivating authentic, cutting-edge research collaborations across the broad range of computing and information application domains as well as studying their economic, commercial and social significance. 
The diversity of our collaborations serves to reshape domains as far reaching as education, art and entertainment, business and law, the environment and biological systems, health care and medicine. 
Consistent with our mission, we are committed to ensuring excellence through inclusion, producing a diverse, educated workforce for advancing technology, stimulating the economy and transferring new technology into the public realm to greatly advance quality of life.
