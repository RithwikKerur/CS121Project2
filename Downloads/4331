About
My work is in the area of statistical machine learning.
I graduated from Padhraic Smyth's DataLab group at UCI.
I was a postdoctoral scholar in Lise Getoor's LINQS research group at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then at the University of California, San Diego.  I am now an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in the Information Systems Department..
