Spring 2022 Week 9: WICS Banquet 

 05/30/2022admin



On Friday, May 27, 2022, WICS held a Banquet at BJ’s celebrating the end of the school year as well as the end to this year’s Mentorship Program. All WICS members–mentors, mentees, committee members, general members, and even some first-time WICS attendees–had the chance to socialize and relax before Week 10 and Finals week. In addition to eating yummy food, like salad, deep dish pizza, and spaghetti, WICS presented awards to Mentorship families. Goodie bags were gifted that contained prizes like light-up panda and dolphin figurines, and silly awards that members nominated each other for were presented. The Banquet ended with all members taking pictures in the sunset to commemorate the event and the wonderful memories made.
