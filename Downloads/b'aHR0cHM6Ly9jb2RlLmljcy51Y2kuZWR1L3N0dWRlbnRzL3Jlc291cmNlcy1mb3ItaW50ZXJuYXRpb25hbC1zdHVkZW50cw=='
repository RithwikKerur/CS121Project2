Resources for Fiscal Year H-1B Cap Season
Change of status from F-1 to H-1B will require employer advising, as H-1B is an employer-sponsored visa category. Neither UCI International Center or MCS/MSWE/MDS will be able to properly advise you on this process. Graduates will need to work directly and very closely with their employers to navigate the steps to sponsorship and receiving an H-1B. Below are some resources to help students better understand the cap season and stay up-to-date throughout the process:

NAFSA: Association of International Educators has an entire resources page dedicated to the H-1B cap season, which includes tips for preparing your H-1B petition, an explanation of the premium processing option, and links to important regulations and document pages.
USCIS has a thorough section on their website dedicated to guiding H-1B petitioners through the process. They also provide a thorough breakdown of H-1B guidelines, documentation requirements, associated fees, and more.

Resources for Academic and Career Success
