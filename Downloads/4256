Software

The CCToolbox: The Curve 
   Clustering Toolbox
A Matlab toolbox for clustering curve data using various probabilistic
   curve-based mixture models. This toolbox essentially implements all of the
   models described in my dissertation.
Cyclone Tracking Toolbox (soon to be released)
   A Matlab toolbox for identifying and tracking cyclones from raw
   MSLP (mean sea-level pressure) data (e.g., in GrADS or NetCDF format).

The Schoolhouse Project
Designed and developed an intelligent web server application 
   for the Schoolhouse
   that used information theoretic techniques to find web pages suitable 
   for young children's education.
