 11/20/201602/23/2017Diana Sandil



On November 18th WICS had a scavenger hunt for everyone in the mentorship program. Mentors and their mentees had an hour to find and take a picture of all the items on the list. The top three mentor mentee duo were given swag bags. It was a fun event for mentors and mentees to bond and to see how much they knew the campus.
