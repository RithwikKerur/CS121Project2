UCI ranked 7th best university for coding in U.S. by HackerRank
December 9, 2016 HackerRank, a free coding practice website that allows developers to hone their coding skills by solving challenges, recently conducted an online competition that ranked UC Irvine 7th in the U.S. and 47th in the world for having the best university coders. More than 5,500 students from 126 schools worldwide participated in the University Rankings Competition, which set out to find which universities had the best coders around the world. The universities were ranked based on both number of participants in the competition and high scores; HackerRank’s engineering team then created a formula to rank each university. Check out the complete list of university rankings on the HackerRank blog.
