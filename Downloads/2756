    				Invented in India    			


InformationWeek has an interesting article — not only for Indians but anybody who wants to understand the global scene — on changes taking place in India. 
The part that I like is:
Technology developed and sold inside India is roughly a $4 billion market that’s expected to grow even faster than its current 20% to 25% rate, reaching $20 billion by 2010. Driving domestic growth, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik says, are near-zero tariffs for imported IT hardware, increasing demand from the middle and upper classes, and falling production costs.
A country can only develop leading edge technology when it becomes a consumer of the technology that it produces.  Until recently, India was producing technology only for use by outsiders.  This basic change and the rapid increase in consumption is a very positive sign of how the gap between developing and developed countries is rapidly narrowing.
