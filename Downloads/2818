    				Micrsoft in enterprise search    			


Micrsoft entering enterprise search through its Sharepoint.  Read details in News.com article by Ina Fried.
The most interesting thing about the approach adopted by Microsoft is to build expertise profiles of people using their e-mail and other information.  Some people may object to this — privacy issues — but this is definitely an interesting approach.  Now I know why they hired Rakesh Agrawal away from IBM — he is an expert in data mining but Rakesh is also a big proponent of Privacy!!!
