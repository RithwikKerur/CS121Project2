‚ÄúThose who ignore statistics are condemned to reinvent it. Statistics is the science of learning from experience‚Äù


Bradley Efron (2006) 













An outline of my research interests, work, values and activities.















Neuroimaging Data


My research tries to unveil the determinants of human behaviors through the analysis of brain imaging data. The brain‚Äôs ability to respond to stimuli and external events changes between individuals and explains individuals‚Äô behaviors and decision-making processes.









Integrative Microbiome Analysis


My research interrogates data at different scales to investigate the role of microbes and their impact on different eco-systems, such as ocean temperature, agricultural outcomes and remediation of pollution. 









Radiomics


One of my interests is in Cancer Radiomics, an emerging discipline promising to elucidate lesion phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity through patterns of enhancement, texture, morphology, and shape. 









Diversity and Inclusion


I am committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive doctoral experience for all our students. 









Bayesian Analysis


 Most of my methodological work is in Bayesian Analysis, and in particular,  Bayesian Nonparametrics . I believe in updating prior beliefs based on observed data and being the most flexible about it!

Complex Data Modeling Research Network


A Network of Different Universities around the world to foster faculty and student interaction and exchange of ideas. 









Our Group


A group of students and faculty that meet every week to discuss and read about research. Get in touch if you want to participate.

  Short Bio
I am a full professor in the Department of Biostatistics at UCLA.I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from¬†Universit√† Bocconi¬†(Milan, Italy) in 2005 under the supervision of Sonia Petrone (Department of Decision Sciences, Universita‚Äô Bocconi, Italy) and Alan E. Gelfand (Department of Statistical Sciences, Duke University).  From 2005 to 2007, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the¬†Department of Biostatistics¬†at the¬†University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, working with Peter Mueller and Gary L. Rosner. I obtained my first faculty position as an Assistant Professor in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New Mexico (2007‚Äì2010). I then held a position as Assistant Professor (with the award of tenure) in the¬†Department of Biostatistics¬†at the¬†University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center¬†(2010-2016).  From 2016 to June 2022, I was a Professor in the Department of Statistics of the  Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).
I am a Fellow of the¬†American Statistical Association (ASA) and the¬†International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA).
