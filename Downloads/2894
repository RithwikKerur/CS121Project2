    				Macrosopes    			


At National University of Singapore, I attended a talk by Prof. Leonidas Guibas of Stanford University on sensor networks.  He had a very interesting perspective on sensor networks — he called them ‘Macrosopes ‘.  I like the characterization.  Microscopes helped us focus on details at micr level — emerging sensor networks and really the EventWeb will help us focus on ‘holistic situation awareness’ and can be definitely considered a macroscope.
