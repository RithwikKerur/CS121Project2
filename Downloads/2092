Visitor Info

The UCI Information Systems Group is located on the 2nd and 3rd floors of Donald Bren Hall (DBH). If you are coming by car, the simplest place to park is the nearby Anteater Parking Structure (APS). APS is an indoor/outdoor parking structure with a manned guard booth that sells visitor permits, and it is just a short, 3-4 minute southwesterly walk from APS to our offices in Donald Bren Hall. Landmark-wise, DBH is right next door to the University Club, which you will likely see signs for. (If you are walking to DBH from APS and reach the University Club, you’ve gone one building too far.) If you are traveling to UCI by cab, the University Club is the drop-off/pick-up point to shoot for. Excellent directional info and local/campus maps can be found at here. More UCI visitor information can be found at http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/visit/index.php as well as http://uci.edu/campusmap/.
