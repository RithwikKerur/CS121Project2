    				Time Machine    			


On O’Reilly’s blog I saw this very interesting visualization approach for time machine.  I think this is worth a look.
I believe that representation and display of temporal information (not videos — but kind of other information) has always been a difficult problem.  Time line and calendars are popular approaches.  But they are not good in many applications.
This approach is definitely not a solution to that.  It is interesting approach, however.
