On March 12, the WICS president, Angela Liu presented to a group of prospective high school female computer science majors. She answered questions about what its like to be in computer science, why they should do computer science and what they can do with computer science. About 25 people attended her talk and were all very glad that she talked to them and helped them understand more about computer science.
