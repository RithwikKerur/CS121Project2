Monday, November 25th, the CIA hosted an info session with WICS. 25 people came and had a chance to hear about multiple job opportunities, benefits, and application processes at the CIA. There were also handouts, free swag, and food at the event.
The CIA offers many internship opportunities for freshmen, sophomores, and graduates. All of these opportunities are located in Washington DC and covers travel fee, more information can be found on their website. Working for the CIA provides many benefits such as health insurance and credit union.
This session taught WICS a lot about what a company looks for in applications, resumes, and cover letters. Working for the CIA is not as hard as it seems and many misconceptions about them were cleared!
