WICS Fall Quarter Week 3: WICS Games 

 10/28/201802/05/2019admin



On Monday, October 15th, WICS hosted the 5th annual WICS Games, an event where company representatives from Google, Blizzard, Intuit, and Amazon along with 90+ students in attendance came together in teams to solve logic and coding puzzles! Each team consisted of a company representative who acted as the mentor of the group of students. Within each team, members attempted to solve rounds of questions with varying level of difficulty to accumulate points to win. A total of three rounds were played, with each round getting more and more difficult. Eventually, one team prevailed and won the ultimate prize: a goody bag of swag! We are thankful to have had representatives from our sponsors and students come to have some challenging fun and enjoy some great food. We hope to see you at our next event!
