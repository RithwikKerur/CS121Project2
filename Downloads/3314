    				Social Search    			


Search is considered an individual’s activity on Internet.  But that may change sometime soon in near future.
A NYT article describes  a project at Microsoft that may change this.  This project is lead by Dr. Meredith Rigel Morris.  

â€œWeb search is usually considered a solitary activity,â€ Dr. Morris said. â€œBut many tasks can benefit from joint searching.â€ 
She notes that people have always collaborated informally in searches, watching over a friendâ€™s shoulder and suggesting alternative search words, for instance, or dividing tasks and then e-mailing the most promising Web sites to one another, along with comments. â€œBut these joint search behaviors arenâ€™t directly supported by standard tools,â€ she said.
