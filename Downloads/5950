Teaching and learning are mirror

who learned to write in this style.




Students accepted to CMU would wear
this badge when visiting the campus; I
sometimes wore it too, because I admit
I'm still a student, learning new things.






I have put my collection of 
   Quotations for Learning and Programing
  on the web.
I hope to continue expanding(and correcting) it.
I always welcome feedback (e.g., corrections, misattributions, other
quotations).





I am starting to index, annotate, and put on the web various
  Education-Related Video Clips.




Here are two websites that I try to read every day; each includes a mix of
  interesting Computer Science
articles that I read selectively. If an incoming freshman reads 5 articles
  per day, they will have read
almost 7,500 articles by the time they graduate.

     (Lecture A 1:30pm - 3:30pm; Lecture B 10:30am - 12:30pm)
  (closed book/closed notes/closed web/closed computer/closed calculator)




  Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) 193: Tutoring in ICS
  No Final Exam; grade based on attendance and timely submission of Journals
     (and Final Assignment)


My Schedule:I'll be in class (lecture/yellow) and/or will hold office hours (gray) all
  days, except Thursday.


Please note that my office hours are open.
There is no need to schedule an appointment ahead of time.
Just drop by.
And, if we need to meet privately, we can do that too.
If you want debugging help, please explore the problem
thoroughly before dropping in, and be ready to report on
your attempts and failures to solve it when we meet.

Interesting Snippets
While developing a manuscript for a textbook on the Ada programming language
  in the late 1980s, I wrote a chapter on 
    EBNF
  and began teaching it on the "first" day of my CS-1 class: primarily as a
   microcosm of programming, but also as a practical tool for later describing
   the syntax of Ada.
These 21 pages (less than 1/4 the size of the original Karel book) discuss
  the sequence, choice, option, repetition, and recursion control structures
  (along with "procedural" abstracton via named EBNF rules).
They explore various methods of proving that tokens satisfy descriptions,
  that descriptions are equivalent (and how to simplify them), and the
  difference between syntax and semantics.
I have continued to use this approach until this day in my CS-1 classes.
In fact, I have rewritten this EBNF chapter for
  an introduction to Python course I am teaching.


An excerpt from the chapter 
  
  "He Fixes Radios by Thinking!" from the book
  
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!":
     Adventures of a Curious Character
  (start at the bottom of page 18: "One day I got a telephone call..." and
   finish at the bottom of page 20: "...never thought that was possible.")
Explains why debugging is best accomplished by thinking, not fiddling.

A short opinion piece on 
  
    What Straight-A Students Get Wrong from the NY Times.
I too have run across many students whose goal is to graduate with a 4.0
  (more at CMU than UCI).
I hope they fall short of that mark early in their studies, so they can
  be freed to pursue getting an education, both inside and
  outside the classroom.
At every school that I have, taught, I have recommend , but so far been 
  ignored, that all entering students receive 1 unit of credit for a
  course called "Getting an Education Sanely".
Every student would uniformly be assigned a grade of A-; then, pursuit of a
  4.0 becomes an asymptotic fantasy.

Admitting these subjects are difficult encourages the most effective learning
  tool that students have: asking questions.

It is scary and compelling at the same time.

Philosphical Musings
Doubts are such tiny things.
A mind with no room for doubts
must have no room for thoughts either. -R. Pattis



The following dialog is from the transcript of "Between Time and Timbuktu"
  (a synthesis of the writings of Kurt Vonnegut).
For more on Bokononism, from which this passage is inspired, see

  The Books of Bokonon (from the novel "Cat's Cradle").


Narrator:
  In the beginning, G-d created the Earth, and he said, "Let there be
    mud."
  And there was mud.
  And G-d said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud
    can see what We have done."
  And G-d created every living creature that now moveth, and one was
    man.
  Mud-as-man alone could speak.
  "What is the purpose of all of this?" man asked politely.
  "Everything must have a purpose?" asked G-d.
  "Certainly." said man.
  "Then I leave it to you to think of one for all of this,"
    said G-d.
  And he went away.
Stony Stevenson:
  I feel very unimportant compared to you [G-d].
Voice of Bokonon:
  The only way you can feel the least bit important
    is to think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and look
    around.
Stony Stevenson:
  I got so much, and most mud got so little.




The following dialog is from Robert Bolt's play "A Man For all Seasons"
  about the life of Sir Thomas More.

William Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!
Sir Thomas More: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the
  law to get after the Devil?
William Roper: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!
Sir Thomas More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil
     turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
   This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws,
     not God's!
   And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really
     think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?
   Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!
