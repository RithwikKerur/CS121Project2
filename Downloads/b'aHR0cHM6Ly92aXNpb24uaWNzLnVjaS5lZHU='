    Welcome to the vision group in ICS at UC Irvine.
    
      Our lab studies computational vision, seeking to understand both the information
      processing capabilities of biological visual systems and develop computer vision
      systems. We are interested theoretical questions as well as practical applications
      ranging from motion capture to biological image analysis.
    

Prospective Students:

      We are actively recruiting qualified undergradute and graduate students who are
      interested in pursuing research in computer vision. Current students are encouraged
      to sit in on our weekly meetings. Applicants interested in pursuing a graduate
      degree should apply via 
      ICS Graduate Admissions and clearly indicate their research interests. The
      yearly deadline is December 15th.
