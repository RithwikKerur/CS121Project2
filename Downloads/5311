WICS Winter Quarter Week 5: CrowdStrike Open House 

 02/08/202003/02/2020admin



On Friday, February 7th, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike invited 20 female WICS members to attend the first ever CrowdStrike Women in Tech Open House. Attendees were given a tour of CrowdStrike’s Irvine office and participated in workshops and speaker sessions. Featured speakers include Director of Professional Services Tim Parisi and Vice President of Cloud Engineering Patrick McCormack. Students then split up to attend different workshops where CrowdStrike employees covered topics like cybersecurity consulting, the transition from IT to security, and a day in the life of a software engineer. The event concluded with a networking mixer where students were allowed to meet women in tech from other schools and chat one-on-one with CrowdStrike recruiters and engineers.
