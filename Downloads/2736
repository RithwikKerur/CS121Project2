    				The Ubiquitous Web    			


W3C consortium is organizing a workshop to discuss issues in the emerging Ubiquitous Web.
The Ubiquitous Web will provide people with access whenever and wherever they find themselves, with applications that dynamically adapt to the user’s needs, device capabilities and environmental conditions. Application mobility will allow users to seamlessly switch between devices whilst continuing to access the same applications. Device limitations will be circumvented through being coupled to other devices and by exploiting networked services as part of distributed applications. As users, we will be able to choose how we interact with these applications according to our current needs and the characteristics of the devices we are using. In one sense, the Web will disappear, as it becomes ubiquitous and taken for granted, thereby vanishing into the background of the global computing and network infrastructure.
Sounds interesting concepts and may make the Web really more ubiquitous.
