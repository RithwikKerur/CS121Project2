 05/06/201905/15/2019admin



On Monday, April 29, WICSâ€™ community outreach committee hosted their Intro to Web Design event! This event was a beginner level workshop open to all majors. During the hands-on workshop, attendees were introduced to HTML and CSS, which they learned to use to create and customize their own web portfolio. At the end, attendees finished making their own website and had basic knowledge about designing web pages. We hope you guys enjoyed this event and found it helpful! ðŸ™‚
