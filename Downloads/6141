Assistant professor at the 

Computer Science Department 

Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences

University of California, Irvine 
Contact: swjun _AT_ ics.uci.edu 

Before joining UC Irvine in 2018, I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2018), working with Professor Arvind. 
I have earned my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University (2010).
 Research Interests 
My research is in innovative system architectures for low-cost high-performance computing.
My two prominent tools right now are Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and reconfigurable hardware accelerators.
