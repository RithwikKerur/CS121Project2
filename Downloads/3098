    				Busy working on EventWeb Project    			


I have been very busy working on the eventweb project.Â  To launch this project, I have to work on the technical side, but equally important thing is to build the team.Â  I am making good progress.Â  This is keeping me away from blog and other activities.Â  Good thing is that it seems that I may be able to launch a nice project.
NUS is a nice place — talented people and very supportive environment.
