Curiosity about the world and a commitment to solving problems are the passions that drive ICS faculty. Their research in the information and computer sciences are applicable to many scholarly and scientific fields. But our faculty don’t do it alone, students work side-by-side with nationally renowned professors to advance knowledge and improve lives. Below is a list of research areas tackled by our faculty.























Algorithms and Complexity Theory

The dominant research theme in our group is algorithm design, studied from several diverse viewpoints: combinatorial optimization; approximation, online, randomized and parallel algorithms; graph algorithms; and algorithmic game theory. A second theme is computational complexity theory, with an emphasis on studying new complexity classes, such as those used for establishing intractability of economic and game-theoretic solution concepts. Other areas of theory studied include computational geometry, data structures, geometric graph theory, quantum computing, spectral graph theory, theory of deep learning, cryptography, and online and matching-based market design.Primary FacultyPierre BaldiMike DillencourtDavid EppsteinMichael GoodrichDan HirschbergSandi IraniStanislaw JareckiMilena MihailIoannis PanageasAmelia ReganVijay VaziraniAffiliate FacultyWayne Hayes

Computer Graphics and Visualization

The field of visual computing deals with generating/capturing, representing, rendering, and interacting with synthetic and real-world images and video. Virtual and augmented reality that involves a different presentation and interaction media, as well as combining real and synthetic worlds are also core aspects of visual computing. Interactive Graphics and Visualization (iGravi) faculty work on end-to-end solutions from capturing of images and geometry; representing large geometric, image, and video data sets; geometry, image, and topology processing; interactive rendering of large visual data sets; algorithms for building large area immersive displays for presentation of visual content; and virtual and augmented reality including spatially augmented reality using projectors, cameras, and interaction devices. Examples of projects include deep learning algorithms for geometry representation, appearance modeling and rendering, medical image processing for 3D reconstruction and topological analysis of anatomical parts, and augmented reality on dynamic surfaces using projector camera systems.iGravi Core (Primary) FacultyAditi MajumderGopi MeenakshisundaramShuang ZhaoiGravi Core (Secondary) Faculty​David EppsteinCharless FowlkesMichael Goodrich

Database and Information Systems

The Database and Information Systems group covers a broad range of topics related to modern data and information systems. ISG faculty research interests include data management, big data systems, multimedia data systems, secure data management, privacy-preserving computation in databases, middleware and distributed systems, concurrency, performance evaluation, data quality and cleaning, text analytics, and data visualization.Much of our research is driven by creating a new generation of end-to-end systems capable of autonomously ingesting data from diverse sources (e.g., sensors, in sensed environment or wearable device contexts, or social media feeds, network monitors, and/or click-stream data), addressing issues related to the volume, velocity, veracity, and variety of such data, extracting and representing such data in a semantically enriched form, ensuring the privacy and security of such data, and building both real-time and analytic systems that scale to the applications’ needs.  Primary FacultyMichael CareyRamesh JainChen LiSharad MehrotraFaisal NawabNalini VenkatasubramanianAffiliate FacultyMichael GoodrichSang-Woo Jun

Software Systems

Software Systems at UCI focuses on the design and implementation of software across the system stack, from embedded devices all the way to large-scale distributed systems. Instead of concentrating on individual layers of the stack, we are particularly interested in cross-cutting concerns such as how to achieve end-to-end security or quality of service or how to partition critical functions of a complex computer system between hardware and software and between clients and servers while pursuing multi-modal goals such as minimizing latency and overall costs while maximizing user privacy and energy efficiency. We are interested in virtualization techniques at all levels, from hypervisors to high-level language runtimes, both from the perspective of designing such virtualization layers as well as deploying them in software architecture. Our research also incorporates topics from areas that traditionally have been called “Software Engineering” and “Trustworthy Computing.” Primary FacultySangeetha Abdu JyothiMichael FranzArdalan Amiri SaniBrian DemskySharad MehrotraMarco LevoratoAlex VeidenbaumNalini VenkatasubramanianAffiliate FacultyAnton BurtsevQi Alfred ChenAlex Nicolau
