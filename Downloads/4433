              		How do the genetic makeup and environment interact to shape intricate developmental processes that lead to functional tissues, organs and 		
                    organisms from undifferentiated cells? This has been a challenging question ever since biologists started wondering about development of 
                    multicellular organisms. The researchers have traditionally used microscopy, mutants and other methods to understand molecular and cellular 
                    bases for development. Recently, genomics is yet another tool added to the developmental biologists' arsenal. With the advances in biological 
                    knowledge, imaging instrumentation, applied biomathematics, and computing, it is now becoming possible to create and apply computational modeling 
                    to integrate multidisciplinary approaches and different types of biological data in studying development.
