Hal Stern Selected as a Fellow of the International Society of Bayesian Analysis
June 29, 2020 
Interim Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Hal Stern is one of nine new fellows selected by the International Society of Bayesian Analysis (ISBA). Stern, a Chancellor’s Professor of Statistics in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), was recognized “for extraordinary contributions to Bayesian theory and methodology; for advancing Bayesian thinking and the principled use of Bayesian methods in a wide range of disciplines, and for his outstanding service to the profession through editorial and administrative positions.”

The first group of fellows was elected in 2012 to honor the ﬁrst ISBA Board of Directors and others who were instrumental in creating ISBA. Ever since, new fellows have been selected biannually, recognizing ISBA members who have made outstanding contributions to the field of statistics though research, teaching, or service to the scientiﬁc community and our society. 
Details can be found in the June 2020 issue of the ISBA Bulletin.
