Research in the Transformative Play Lab is broadly interdisciplinary.  We are concerned with questions of identity, justice, playfulness, design, and futurity. We ground our work in a combination of media studies methods (close reading of games and systems), design methods (creating research prototypes and speculative designs), and ethnographic methods (studying communities of practice). On this page we lay out the major threads of research within the group.
