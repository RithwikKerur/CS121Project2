2014S-274b-ProjectIdeas


Some possible project ideas and associated papers.  You do not need to choose something on this list; it is just a list of possibilities to get you started.  You may structure your project exploration around a general problem type, algorithm, or data set, but should explore around your problem, testing thoroughly or comparing to alternatives.

You should turn in a write-up (< 10 pages) describing your project and its outcomes, similar to a research-level publication (journal or CS conference).  This is due by 5pm Friday 6/13, to EEE.
