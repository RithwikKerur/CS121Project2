Biography
Sharad
    Mehrotra is a Professor in the School
    of Information and Computer
    Science at University of California,
    Irvine
    and Director of the  Center for Emergency
    Response Technologies (CERT) at UCI. He also serves as the Director and PI of
    the RESCUE project (Responding to Crisis and Unexpected Events) which,
    funded by NSF through its large ITR program, spans 7 schools and consists
    of 60 members. He is associated with the Cal-IT2 institute -- a
    multidisciplinary research facility spanning University
    of California, Irvine
    and University of California,
    San Diego.
    He is the recipient of Outstanding Graduate Student Mentor Award in 2005.
    Prior to joining UCI, me was a member of the faculty at University
     of Illinois,
    Urbana Champaign in the Department of Computer Science where he was the
    recipient of the C. W. Gear Outstanding Junior Faculty Award. Mehrotra has
    also served as a Scientist at Matsushita Information
    Technology Laboratory immediately after graduating with a Ph.D. from University of
    Texas at Austin(1988-1993).
 
Mehrotra's research expertise is in data management and distributed systems
    areas in which he has made many pioneering contributions. Two such
    contributions include the concept of "database as a service"  and "use of information retrieval
    techniques, particularly relevance
    feedback, in multimedia search". Mehrotra is a recipient of numerous
    best paper nominations and awards including  SIGMOD
    Best Paper award in 2001 for a paper entitled  "Locally Adaptive
    Dimensionality Reduction for Indexing Large Time Series Databases",
    Best of VLDB 1994 submissions for a paper entitled "Concurrency Control in Hierarchical Multidatabase System", best paper award in
    DASFAA 2004 for the paper entitled "Efficient
    Execution of Aggregation Queries over Encrypted Databases", best paper award nomination for a paper
    entitled Neighborhoods:
    A framework for enabling web-based synchronous collaboration and
    hierarchical Navigation at HIICS, 1996, and a best student paper award at IEEE
    Workshop on Multimodal Sentient Computing: Sensors, Algorithms and Systems
    (WMSC 2007) held in conjunction with IEEE CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern
    Recognition) 2007.
 
Mehrotra's
    current research focuses on building sentient spaces using multimodal
    sensors, data privacy, and data quality. Mehrotra's
    recent research, particularly, in the context of RESCUE & CERT has
    focused on situational awareness from multimodal input including
    conversational speech data. Many of his research contributions have been
    incorporated into software artifacts which are now
    in use at various first responder partner sites.
