WICS Fall Quarter Week 3: WICS Games 

 10/30/202011/06/2020admin



On Monday, October 19th, 2020 of Week 3, we had 13 company representatives from all sorts of companies including CrowdStrike, Google, Cisco, Taco Bell, Bllizzard and more who came out and played with 50+ students! WICS Games is one of the largest events that we host every year and although it was virtual, it still held the same themes of fun and connecting with others! We had a blast playing with each other through brain teasers, logical puzzles, and even some light coding questions, and it was a fun experience, congrats to the teams that won swag!
