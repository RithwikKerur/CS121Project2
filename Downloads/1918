Table of contents
Default actions
Enable diag actions
Script actions
Cookbook actions

Page actions are applied to wiki pages, as a query string appended to the URL.
Security can be applied to all default actions, and script actions with one exception, but not diag actions, through the use of passwords.

Also documented are all other URL queries.

NOTE: All actions will be disabled if the following is set:


    $EnableActions = 0;
    include('pmwiki.php');

This will initialize PmWiki (along with any configuration/customizations
that are being made, e.g. from local/config.php), but won't actually
perform any actions.  The caller can then call the desired action
or other functions as desired. This is available from Version 2.2.0-beta22 on up.

Actions enabled by $EnableDiag

The following actions are available only if you set $EnableDiag = 1; in your configuration file. They can be used for debugging and should not be set in a production environment.

?action=ruleset displays a list of all markups in 4 columns:
column 1 = markup-name (1. parameter of markup() )
column 2 = when will rule apply (2. parameter of markup() )
column 3 = PmWiki's internal sort key (derived from #2)
column 4 = Debug backtrace information for potentially incompatible rules (filename, line number, pattern)
(see Custom Markup  Using the Markup() function for custom wiki syntax; migration to PHP 5.5 ).
To see more than what ?action=ruleset gives you, apply the Cookbook:MarkupRulesetDebugging recipe: it can also show the pattern and the replacement strings.
