WICS Fall Quarter Week 1: First General Meeting 

 10/02/201910/09/2019admin



Last Monday, September 30th, WICS hosted its first General Meeting for fall quarter. One hundred fifty people RSVP’d for this event! Members had a chance to grab some pizza and drinks and socialize with other members, as well as committee and board members. Co-presidents Cheyenne Chavez and Sharon Hsu led the meeting, introduced WICS board and committee members, and spoke about WICS’s mission, upcoming events, and more ways to get involved. The meeting concluded with an exciting game of Kahoot that tested our new member’s knowledge of WICS’s logistics, and those who achieved the highest scores received swag bags. We had a great start to the school year, and we hope to see all of you at our future events!
