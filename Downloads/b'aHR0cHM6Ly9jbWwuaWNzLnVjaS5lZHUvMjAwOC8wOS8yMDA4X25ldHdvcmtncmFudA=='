Along with Center members Michael Goodrich, David Eppstein, and Carter Butts, computer science professor and director of the Center for Machine Learning Padhraic Smyth has received a five-year, $5.4 million grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research to study large-scale networks with millions of nodes.  The goal is to understand how networks the size of Facebook and LinkedIn are formed and how they evolve over time.  The multidisciplinary effort spans the spectrum from theoretical computer science to the social sciences and will involve faculty with expertise ranging from algorithms to graph visualization, machine learning, statistics, sociology and behavioral science.
