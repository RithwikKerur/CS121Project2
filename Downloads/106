Large Scale Mutation Analysis
 

































I am aiding core developers of the Linux kernel to use mutation analysis to improve kernel systems testing methods, and to verify critical algorithms. I am also investigating the use of bounded model checking (CBMC) on Linux kernel. As an outcome of this project so far we have identified 3 bugs in the Linux kernel. I am also applying mutation analysis on sqlite3 to improve its testing.
