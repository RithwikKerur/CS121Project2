Professor Tsudik Elected to Inaugural Cohort of IFIP Fellows
November 8, 2019 
At the most recent General Assembly of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) in Kiev, Ukraine, the Fellows Selection Committee reviewed nominations and elected the inaugural cohort of IFIP Fellows. Included in this cohort is Distinguished Professor of Computer Science Gene Tsudik, elected in recognition of his professional standing and expertise as well as his contributions to IFIP through working groups and technical committees.

IFIP is a non-governmental, non-profit umbrella organization for national societies working in the field of information processing. It was established in 1960 under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a result of the first World Computer Congress held in Paris in 1959.
At the IFIP 60th anniversary celebration to be held at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on 28 September 2020, new IFIP Fellows will be officially inducted. Gene Tsudik hopes to attend the anniversary celebrations if it doesn’t interfere with his teaching schedule.
