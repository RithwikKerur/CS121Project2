Hi! I'm Adriana
Ph.D. student in the Department of Informatics at UC Irvine.













I am a Researcher
Member of the Software Design and Collaboration Laboratory (SDCL)
I study software designers and how they interact with tools to document design work.

My Research





One problem designers confront in practice is capturing design information produced during design meetings, which usually take place as informal conversations at the whiteboard. Another equally important problem is bringing that design information back during future meetings, right 'in-the-moment' the developers need it.
Nowadays, both activities most likely require heavyweight processes, and the tool support available is usually obtrussive, with interactions that hinder the developers from actively participating in the meeting. Therefore, developers barely use them.
My research attempts to address this tandem-problem through the development and evaluation of lightweight tools to (semi-) automatically capture and deliver important design information.
