Internship Contact, Student & Employer Outreach
Jaclyn Kung, Career Development Manager, will be the primary liaison between the employer and UCI throughout the duration of the internships.  Jaclyn will also serve as a mentor to students and assess the academic merit of their work in partnership with the MCS Faculty Director.  Jaclyn may also reach out and keep in touch with participating students and employers to assess how the internships are going logistically, and solicit feedback on the internship assignments and evaluations.
