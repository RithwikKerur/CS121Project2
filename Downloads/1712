Plots

Plot of kernel density estimate for the mean estimate of the flock after 50 steps versus a kernel density estimate for the 5000 samples from the corresponding normal distribution.


Plot of the mean estimate for the flock over 50 time steps


Histogram of the joint (r(t+day,day),r(t,day)). A histogram of the number of returns at time t+day between (a,b] and the return was between (c,d] at time t. The ranges for the histogram was determined by finding percentiles of the data 0:1:100


Same as above except delta t = 5 min


Same as above except delta t = 30 min
