A Workshop on:
Health, Food, Nutrition, and Data






The Department of Computer Science, Ashoka University is hosting a workshop on Health, Food, Nutrition and Data on the 7th and 8th of December, 2021. The workshop aims to explore the possibilities for applying techniques from data analytics and computer science to key problems in health and nutrition, with a special emphasis on India. The main aims of the workshop will be to:

Understand the key factors affecting health in India
Identify existing data sources, their gaps and error models, and possibilities of generating new data for health analytics
Explore the possibilities of building a data repository and data analytics centre at Ashoka for health, nutrition and the environment. This may be made available to a global community of researchers
Explore the possibilities of building a consortium of researchers, government and non-government organizations, healthcare and environmental groups, industry and start-ups to carry out multidisciplinary research on health, food and environment.
Try to define a few (2 or 3 ) concrete research questions that we can start with.
