Spring 2021 Week 2: Mentorship Workshop #3 

 04/10/202104/23/2021admin



On Friday, April 9th, WICS held their third and final Mentorship Workshop to allow families to continue working on their websites. For this workshop, the mentors and mentees were able to learn how to work with Git Branches, Pull Requests and Heroku. The demonstration included showing families how to use pull requests when different members of the families have made edits at the same time. The website, Heroku, was introduced so that families could finally deploy their websites, making it accessible for all. All of the families put a lot of effort into their websites and the workshop series was a huge success in terms of allowing pairings to bond over CS-related topics. We are all excited to see the final websites at the Mentorship Banquet!
