Welcome Sergio! 



Our group continues to grow!  We are very excited to welcome Sergio Villaverde Herrera to the laboratory.  He is joining us for the year as an education abroad student from the University of Granada, Spain, and is exploring building a scalable server side to Calico (scalable to many many users).
