Formal Languages and Automata Theory



ICS 162, Fall 2003:
Formal Languages and Automata Theory


General Course Information

Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final
exam.  The course letter grade will be determined on a curve,
combining numerical scores for homeworks (15%), midterm (35%),
and final (50%).
Group work on homeworks is permitted; each student should turn in his 
or her own copy of the homeworks. The course text will be
Introduction to the Theory of Computation, by Michael Sipser (PWS
Publishing, 1997).

The course meets Tuesdays
and Thursdays, 9:30 - 10:50 in CS 180.
I will be available for office hours Mondays and Wednesdays 2:00 - 3:00
in my office, CS 358D.
The TA for the course is Kevin Wortman
<kwortman@ics.uci.edu>.
Kevin's office hours will be Mondays
1:00 - 2:00 and Thursdays 3:00 - 4:00 in CST 124, the office down the
hall from the distribution center.
