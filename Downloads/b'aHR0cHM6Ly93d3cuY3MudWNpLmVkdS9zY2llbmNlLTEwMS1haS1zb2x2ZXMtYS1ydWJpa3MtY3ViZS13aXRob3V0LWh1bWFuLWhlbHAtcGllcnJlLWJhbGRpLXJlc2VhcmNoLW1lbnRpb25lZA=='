Science 101: “AI solves a Rubik’s cube without human help” (Pierre Baldi research mentioned)
September 27, 2019 
While computers have been solving Rubik’s cubes with regularity, they typically required some coaching and interaction from humans. This time, at the University of California, Irvine, researchers programmed a machine-learning algorithm, called DeepCubeA, to solve a Rubik’s Cube completely on its own. The algorithm did astonishingly well. At best, the puzzle was solved in under a second and with less than 20 moves. According to reports, results were consistent as the test was repeated, with AI solving 100 percent of the tests and identifying the fastest route to a solution 60 percent of the time.
