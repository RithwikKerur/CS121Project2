Winter 2022 Week 2: Mock Technical Interview Prep 

 01/31/2022admin



On Monday, January 24, 2022, WICS held a practice session to help prepare attendees for the Mock Technical Interview event in the upcoming week. Attendees were divided into groups and given a variety of technical problems to solve- ranging from Data Structures to OOP concepts. Each group worked together to come up with the right answers to the questions. After every round, the solution was revealed and discussed, giving everyone the opportunity to learn and deepen their understanding of common interview topics. WICS members also shared interview tips and advice for attendees.
