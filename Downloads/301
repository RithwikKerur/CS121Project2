Victor Gonzalez


Ph.D. Information and Computer Science, 2006
Why did you choose this degree?
Because the reputation of the program and the opportunity of working with the faculty and in projects of high impact.
What has been your career path since graduating with a Ph.D.?

Lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction at the School of Informatics of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom
Lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction at the Manchester School of Business of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom
Associate Professor and Researcher at the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Mexico
Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM), Mexico (current position)
Head of Department at the Department of Computer Science at Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM), Mexico (current position)
Co-Director of the EPIC Lab: ITAM Center of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at at Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM), Mexico (current position)

What do you enjoy most about your current position?
I love teaching, I love helping students to define innovation-based entrepreneurship, I love doing research with my students and colleagues from all over Mexico and the world.
What does a typical work day look like for you?
I start very early in the morning (4:30 a.m.), play with my dog at around 6 a.m., prepare breakfast and head to leave my son at his school and then to my workplace (ITAM University) (7:30 a.m.). Most of my days are a mixed of planned an unplanned meetings and “Constant, constant, multi-tasking craziness” (Gonzalez & Mark 2004). I love what I do and I enjoy the mix of admin, teaching, research and consulting activities that define my days. I do a lot of external linking with companies in Mexico and in other parts of the world. The best moments at the office are those when I meet my students and see what direction their projects have taken. I also love those days when I do consulting and can see the value of theory in practice and practitioners being touched by the value of sound academic research.
What was the best part of your experience at UCI?
The networking: the fact of being surrounded by so many valuable people. The multidisciplinarity: be able to discover that Information and Computer Science can only be understood when you look at it from the multidisciplinary perspective. What other place in the world can you find a School of Information and Computer Science with such mix of high caliber faculty members from so diverse disciplines?
In what way(s) did your studies prepare you for your career to date?
I feel that I was very well prepared as a researcher and as an academic and I believe that I could not get better training: I worked for, with and together with the best people.
What would be your advice to incoming students who might want to follow a similar career path?
You have to understand that UCI has strong roots in the Information and Computer Science field around the globe. Many important, intelligent and innovative people have been part of ICS and they keep the connection with UCI. You come to join a true community with tradition, reputation and relevance in the field of Information and Computer Science.
