Kay Family Foundation Innovation Lab

Thanks to a generous gift from the Kay Family Foundation, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences now features a mobile technology lab designed to foster student collaboration.
The Kay Family Foundation Innovation Lab features state-of-the-art equipment, including Apple TVs and a PolyVision smartboard. MacBook Airs and iPads also are available for checkout to students enrolled in a Bren School major who are in good academic standing.
The lab is located in ICS2, Room 110.
Lab Availability and Policies
Access to the Kay Family Foundation Innovation Lab will be granted on a quarterly basis to students in a Bren School of ICS major. Students must request access from the Bren School facilities via keys.ics.uci.edu, specifying Shannon Rudder (srudder) as Supervisor. Access to the lab is 7am to 10pm daily. Access will expire at the end of each quarter.
Important Guidelines: 

Students are not to open the door for unauthorized users, at the risk of losing room privileges for a full quarter. Students are not to prop the door open, at the risk of losing room privileges permanently.
Food or drinks (including water) are not allowed in the lab, and anybody found with food/drink in the room will lose room privileges for a full quarter.

The lab will be monitored via periodic checks by ICS Student Council members who helped design the lab and develop these policies. The ICS Student Council has been tasked with supporting the Bren School in its enforcement of these rules.
Periodically, the lab may be reserved for a class or seminar. Please check if the room is available for use (or booked). Check Schedule 
 
Laptop Checkout Program
Students must be enrolled in a Bren School major and must be in good academic standing in order to check out a laptop. These devices may be checked out for one quarter at a time — one device per student — via online reservation only.
