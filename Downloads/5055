WICS Fall Quarter Week 3: Zillow Interview Workshop 

 10/19/201910/23/2019admin



On Friday, Oct 18, reps from Zillow Group came to DBH to host a Zillow Interview Workshop! After everyone grabbed pizza and swag, Monique, a recruiter, and Usha, a software engineer, led a presentation about the kind of work that Zillow does and how to approach technical interviews. Attendees asked many questions, and we learned a lot of great interview tips! We also got to share our resumes and meet with them afterwards. Thanks to Zillow and to all the attendees for coming out! We hope everyone’s ready to kill their next interview!
