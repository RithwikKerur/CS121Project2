Subcultures, Design Fictions and HCI Futures 















We’re studying how different marginalized and non-normative subcultural practices (Steampunk Making, DIY and Hacking, Survivalism and Prepping, Cosplay and Fandom, etc.) prototype alternative paths for technology use, defamiliarize existing techno-social practices, and create alternative design spaces that challenge existing rhetorics of technological monoculture. Alongside this, we are studying the role of popular culture, media, and science fiction in conceptualizing and communicating the ethical, ideological, and social implications of new technologies, and for better understanding the ways in which public narratives shape decision making about new technologies.Associated Publications2012 CHI Paper: Steampunk as Design Fiction2012 TEI Studio: Design Fictions2013 CHI Paper: Democratizing Technology: Pleasure, Utility and Expressiveness in DIY and Maker Practice2013 Interactions Article: Steampunking Interaction Design2014 CHI Workshop: Critical Making Hackathon: Situated Hacking, Surveillance, and Big Data2014 CHI Workshop: Alternate Endings: Using Fiction to Explore Design Futures2014 Interactions Article: Design Fictional Interactions: Why HCI Should Care About Stories2015 Book Chapter: Fabricating Futures:Envisioning Scenarios for Home Fabrication Technology2016 DiGRA Talk: Surviving Fallout 4: A Design Fiction2016 LIMITS Paper: The Limits of Our Imagination: Design Fiction as a Strategy for Engaging with Dystopian Futures2016 Interactions Article: Furious Futures and Apocalyptic Design Fictions: Popular Narratives of Sustainability2017 Energy Research & Social Science Article: What if there had only been half the oil?
