Class: Donald Bren Hall (DBH) 1423, Wednesday 2pm-4:20pm
Instructors: Rina Dechter (Bren 4232) and Alex Ihler (Bren 4066)

Overview
The seminar will focus on recent advances in graphical models reasoning and knowledge representation, as well as on exploring some application areas.
Each student will be involved in presenting papers/chapters and will be encouraged to focus on a project of interest. Students will write a final report for their research project.
