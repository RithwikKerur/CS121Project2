On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms.
D. Eppstein.

SIGACT News 18 (3): 38–40, 1987.

A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
alphametic)
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.
