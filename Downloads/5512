Forbes: “Four Ways To Maximize Workplace Productivity By Checking Your Technology Use” (Gloria Mark research cited)




Today’s technology landscape is stippled with countless innovations designed to increase productivity, both in and outside of the workplace. … A recent UC Irvine study found that it takes 23 minutes on average to return to a task after an interruption. Though it may sound counterintuitive, email is the biggest interruption in day-to-day corporate life.

Luminaries from the Game Industry Take Over Classes as Guest Lecturers

April 25, 2018


“Thrilled to have @ThePouncer guest lecture on the trust framework he presented at GDC this year,” recently tweeted Informatics Professor Kurt Squire. “Students loved it.”
In case you’re wondering, “ThePouncer” is Aaron Cammarata, technical project lead at Google Advanced Technology and Products (ATAP). He is a game designer with more than 16 years of industry experience, including as founder of voidALPHA, a full-service game studio in the San Francisco Bay Area. Yet Cammarata wasn’t the only luminary to recently visit UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science (ICS).

Senior Spotlight: Matthew Ardeleanu Exemplifies Perseverance on Road to Success

April 23, 2018



When Matthew Ardeleanu first started at UCI, the aspiring radiologist with an interest in computer science thought he was invincible. Half-way through his college career, while working 30 hours a week, he learned that wasn’t the case. Juggling school and work proved more challenging than expected, but now, after mastering time management and overcoming academic disqualification, he is graduating this summer with a B.S. in health informatics and plans for continued success.

Researchers from the Department of Informatics Explore Sustainable Food Systems

April 20, 2018


When you think of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), farming might not be the first thing that comes to mind. Yet research being conducted in the Department of Informatics is advancing the use of technology for sustainable agriculture.
A sustainable food system “brings farmers closer to consumers by producing fruits and vegetables, or raising livestock or fish closer to the places they are sold.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “a move towards sustainable food has become an important component of public and environment health.”

April 16, 2018


From serving as a resident advisor for UCI’s Middle Earth Housing and volunteering to teach high school girls how to code, to studying at the University of Manchester and acting as a study-abroad peer mentor, Celine Deleon has made the most of her college experience. The informatics senior is now ready to graduate this spring and already has a user experience job lined up at Disney. For someone who decided back in high school that she wanted to inspire women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, Deleon is off to a great start.

The Atlantic: “The Bargain at the Heart of the Kid Internet” (Mimi Ito quoted)

April 12, 2018


“There’s huge incentives for [kids] and families to lie about age”—as in, confirming that kids are 13 or older when they’re not—“so even the data [about users that companies keep] gets corrupted,” Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist and professor at the University of California, Irvine, told me. Kids (and parents) want engaging, cheap, or free videos regardless of how old they are ….
