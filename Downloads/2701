    				More video coming    			


Now Reuter will also allow their video to be used by others.  Along with CNN’s efforts, this may start bringing more video reports on the Web.  And yes, Blinkx is also going to allow you to download things to iPod.
Are we seeing the web finally starting to really becoming more visual?
