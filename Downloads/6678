Course Updates

Fall 2022: ICS Course Restrictions
﻿This timeline for ICS course restrictions updates is being provided to help students with planning during the open enrollment period.
It is highly recommended that students check this page periodically.  The timeline will be followed for the most part, but course restrictions are subject to change, such as in the case of highly impacted courses where restrictions may be extended or adjusted at a time other than initially planned.
ICS Student Affairs reserves the right to adjust restrictions and the timeline at any time.
Go directly to timeline:    Undergraduate
Notable updates:   - 5/2/22: F22 information published.   - 5/24/22: CS 183 added to list of courses ineligible for waitlist.   - 6/1/22: Updates to timeline, re: ICS 45J, Stat 110, Stats 120A restriction timeline.   - 8/2/22: updates to timeline, re: NOR and School/Major restrictions (see 8/22 and 8/26)

Waitlists on eligible School of ICS courses will be activated on May 24, 2022 at 9:00am.
New Only Reserved (NOR): Certain courses will have a portion of or all seats reserved for incoming freshmen and transfer students.
Course prerequisites: The online listing will be updated by May 13, 2022. Until then, refer to the General Catalogue for the most accurate and up-to-date prerequisite information.

Important: If you satisfied any part of a course's prerequisite(s) at another institution and you have not yet been cleared to enroll in that course, be sure to submit an Online Course Prerequisite Clearing Request.


School of ICS majors will have priority for seating in most School of ICS courses until 12:00pm, August 29, 2022. See the detailed timeline for specific information.

If a course is a core requirement for an ICS degree, first consideration is given to students in that major.
If a course is a Specialization or Track requirement for an ICS degree, second consideration is given to students pursuing that Specialization or Track.
If a course is a core requirement for a degree outside of ICS, third consideration will be given to students in that major following the schedule outlined on this page.

Majors outside of the School of ICS may begin enrolling in ICS courses on August 29, 2022 at 12:00pm.
