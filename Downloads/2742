    				Cameras    			


NYT has David Pogue’s excellent ‘update’ on digital camera market.
Cameras are slowly becoming ‘Pen’ of the past.  They will be used to make your experiences persistent.  And this has really very interesting implications for our society.  I already see in conferences several people who use their cameras more than their pen to take notes in talks.  And of course phone cams are rapidly getting to the stage (I consider 3 Meg pixels as the turing point) where even inexpensive models will serve well for taking modern notes everywhere.
Have you started using cameras to take pictures of slides on screens or menus or any article that you see in a magazine?  If not, you are not using technology effectively.  🙂
