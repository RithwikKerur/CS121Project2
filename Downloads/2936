    				Pacific Rim Multimedia Conference: Day 1    			


The first day at the conference was very interesting. Â The day started with a 30 minute opening session and had two key note talks. Â There were lots of papers in all aspects of multimedia ranging from retrieval to coding. Â Suddenly there seems to be a surge in interest in multiview coding. Â There was a tutorial also on this topic and several papers in this area here.
The first keynote was by Ya-Qin Zhang on Mobile computing.Â  He is the corporate vice president of Microsoft and is the director of Microsoftâ€™s R&D in China. Â He outlined what are the challenges in Mobile computing and how Microsoft is dealing with it.Â  His talk is described here.
I gave the second keynote talk.Â  There was some pressure on me. Â From the morning introductory session I have been called â€˜the father of multimediaâ€™ â€“ I had people using this term for me informally, but never so openly on stage and in introductions. Â This does put you under pressure.Â  In any case, I decided to champion the notion of event-based modeling and EventWeb in the talk. Â The abstract of the talk is here.Â  And the presentation is here.
In the evening there was a nice reception with a great Chinese orchestra.Â  I am posting pictures at flickr.Â  You can either search with tag PCM06 or go to my stream at www.flickr.com/photos/rameshjain.
I will also post several of these events at beta.seraja.com.Â  Again I will use the tag PCM06.
