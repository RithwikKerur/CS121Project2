Student Helper 



Project #:  32 




Members:Abhishek Jha, Karan Rao, Karan Uppin, Sitesh Pattanaik






Description:A common platform that facilitates the interaction between students, professors, and prospective employers about their capstone projects. By giving a unified platform for students to showcase their projects, professors to monitor and track them, and employers to propose a selection of projects for students to pick from, it eliminates the need for any intermediaries for communication between these parties.
