Winter Quarter 2017 Week 1: General Meeting 

 01/11/201704/10/2017Diana Sandil



Wednesday, January 11th, was the first kick-off WICS general meeting of Winter 2017! 50 wonderful faces, both familiar and new, came to the first meeting with renewed resolution for a wonderful start to the quarter. Our awesome speakers introduced WICS, the wonderful board members, and exciting WICS-hosted events for this quarter. Our friends has a lot to look forward to! We then made some new friends with a fun ice breaker, the Human Knot. Finally, we concluded our meeting decked in swag after a lively raffle competition. Students had a great time getting to know WICS and left learning about future opportunities for professional and social connections from these WICS-hosted events. Mark down the dates to your calendar! This is going to be a great quarter.
