A current finance competition
Equitrader is running its second annual Colligate Challenge with $25,000 in prizes.  Equitrader uses the same competition based business model as TopCoder but rather than designing software, we run virtual stock trading competitions. Registration runs from September 1, 2008 through October 31, 2008, and is open to all students over age 18.  The competition will run from September 29, 2008 to March 15, 2009.  Whether you are a new-comer, novice, or expert, come test your skills against other students from around the world.

For more details and registration visit the Equitrader home page(www.equitrader.com) and click on the Collegiate Challenge banner in the center of the page.  Thank you and good luck!
