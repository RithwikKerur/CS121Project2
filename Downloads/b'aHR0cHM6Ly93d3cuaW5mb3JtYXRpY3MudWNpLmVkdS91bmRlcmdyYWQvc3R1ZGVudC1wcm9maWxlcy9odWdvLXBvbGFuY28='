Hugo Polanco


Informatics
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your studies?
I chose UC Irvine because I wanted to experience a campus that was a bit far away from the craziness that is Los Angeles. I had also heard great things about the city of Irvine, which drew me in more to coming here.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
I think the most enjoyable part is being able to meet new people share the same interests as myself.
Have you done an internship?
I have done a couple of internships now. My most recent is working at Thales Avionics as an ERP project manager intern. Here, I’ve been able to see what goes on in the creation of a project from the beginning to the end.
Have you done research?
Yes, I have done research. I was part of the WellConnect team with Dr. Karen Cheng and Dr. Gillian Hayes. I was in charge of the research and analysis for our project, which aimed at providing a self-help tool for users suffering from clinically diagnosed depression.
Are you pursuing a minor or double major?
I am pursuing my minor in health informatics. I wanted to be able to have the option to go into the healthcare field with a more technical background, and hopefully this will allow me to be able to become a part of that.
What are you most proud of so far?
I can definitely say that being a first generation college student in my family is what I am most proud of as of now. I have another year to go, but I plan on making my family proud as well.
What has been the best part of your experience?
I’ve been able meet different people, interact with them and share this college experience, as well as being able to take everything that I’ve learned so far and put it to use within research as well as internships that I’ve been able to do.
What are your aspirations?
I want to work in the technical field, but I’m not exactly sure what I want to be.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
My advice for incoming students would be for them to get involved early, know what you want to do or get out of the program, and just go for it. I waited until my third year to get involved, and I really wish I had done so earlier, in order to get to experience more.
