"[I]n the fall of 1994, Intel admitted that its
highly touted and widely sold Pentium chip was not 100% reliable in carrying
out arithmetic calculations. Intel admitted the flaws only after a mathematician
publicy criticized t he chip's accuracy. Further, Intel lost credibility
when it minimized the importance of the problem and was unwilling to automatically
replace the millions of Pentium chips that it had sold. Intel's spokesperson
claimed that the computational errors were exceptionally rare and would
show up only in specially complex calculations. Critics retorted that the
errors could occur more frequently and that even common financial calculations,
could lead to erroneous results."
Kling, Computers and Controversy, p 752
Intel finally agreed to replace the chip for anybody
who wanted a replacement. What are the ethical responsibilities of the
manufacturer of a faulty product? How "faulty" does the product have to
be? What actions do you think Intel took to prevent future occurrences
of this kind of problem? What do you think Intel will do if this kind of
problem happened again?

Just a few years ago, AOL, in an effort to get more
business, adopted an "all-you-can-eat" pricing policy. For a fixed monthly
fee, a customer could get unlimited access to AOL. Previously, AOL had
a "pay-per-view" pricing policy. The new pricing policy resulted in overwhelming
demand both from old customers and new customers. AOL's resources were
overloaded and customers could not get into the system. AOL apologized,
gave refunds, and make a crash effort to improve capacity.
One thing which caused the overloading was customers
leaving their machines connected all of the time. When a customer has trouble
getting in, the customer will just leave the connection open. AOL tried
to curtail this behavior by dropping the connection to customers who didn't
show any activity for a certain period of time. Of course, this action
by AOL made customers mad.
What is the responsibility of a vendor who oversells
capacity? What can a vendor do to prevent overselling? How is this case
the same or different than the Israel cell phone case?
