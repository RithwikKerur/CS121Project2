Visit ICS


We can offer virtual tours, pictorials and viewbooks but nothing will substitute for an in-person visit.
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) is the first and only computer science school in the University of California, offering visitors opportunities to attend academic lectures, interact with leading computer science researchers and recruit intelligent and out of the box thinking computer science students.
If you're interested in attending ICS and want to learn more about a particular degree program - even meet with faculty doing research that piques your interest - please call the Student Affairs Office at (949) 824-5156 to check when you can meet with a graduate counselor. If you are unable to come to campus, please email gcounsel@ics.uci.edu for more information.
Campus walking tours are offered almost every Monday through Friday. Please check the Tour Calendar for available times and to ensure that there is a tour offered on the day you wish to visit. 
Directions to the Bren School » From LAX (42 miles from UCI) » From John Wayne (5 miles from UCI) » From major freeways (405, 73, 55, 5)
