Fall 2021 Week 6: Mentorship Social at UTC 

 11/12/2021admin



On Friday, November 5, 2021, WICS mentorship program held their first social at the UTC! Mentors and mentees hung out with their respective families, with most families sharing a meal or grabbing boba together in the nearby restaurants. Some mentors even brought various games to play with their families such as Uno and Jenga. Overall, it was a great way for families to get to know each other better!
