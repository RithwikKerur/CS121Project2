Winter 2021 Week 7: WICS Mentorship Workshop #2 

 02/22/202104/23/2021admin



On Friday, February 19, various mentorship families came out to continue working on their family website! The mentors and mentees were given an overview of how to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to help set up their Home and About Us pages. Families were given time in breakout sessions to plan and collaborate on creating their website navigation bar and adding pictures and fun facts about themselves. There was a lot of great progress, and all the websites are looking amazing!
