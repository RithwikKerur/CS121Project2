Welcome to the ER-leap download page. 

ER-leap is an accelerated SSA equivalent stochastic simulator. The algorithm was discovered primarily by Eric Mjolsness at UCI. 


The code is written in C++. It requires the libSBML library before being compiled.
It was developed using Mac OS X (v10.4) although other operating systems and environments are expected to work. 
Dependencies
