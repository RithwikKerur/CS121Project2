Professor Michael Franz Elected IFIP Fellow
November 8, 2019 
At its most recent General Assembly in Kiev, Ukraine, the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) elected Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science Michael Franz to its inaugural cohort of 48 IFIP Fellows. The Fellow Award recognizes individuals of the highest professional standing and expertise in one of IFIP’s constituent societies (which includes ACM) who have also contributed directly to IFIP.

Established in 1960 under the auspices of UNESCO, IFIP is the global organization for researchers and professionals working in the field of information and communication technologies. IFIP is recognized by the United Nations and links some 50 national and international societies and academies of science with a total membership of over half a million professionals.
The Fellow Award pins and certificates will be presented at a ceremony at the Maison de l’UNESCO in Paris in September 2020.
Prof. Franz is already a Fellow of the ACM, the global professional society of Computer Scientists, and a Fellow of the IEEE, the global professional society of Engineers.
