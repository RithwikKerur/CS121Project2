ML Reading Group 


This is an informal reading group open to all UCI students and faculty. Each week we will read and discuss an interesting paper selected by the group.
Everyone who attends is expected to have read the paper and contribute to the discussion. Please note at least one point about the paper that you would like to discuss. This may be a question you have or an interesting idea that you would like to highlight.
Mailing list: mlrg
Next meeting: TBA
