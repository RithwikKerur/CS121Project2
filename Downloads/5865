About Me:

I am an Associate Professor of Nursing and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). I am also the Associate Director of the UCI Institute for Future Health, a campus-wide organized research unit (ORU) focusing on personal health empowerment. I lead the multi-disciplinary HealthSciTech Group at UCI. Prior to joining UCI as a faculty, I was an EU Marie Curie Global Fellow in the Computer Science Department of University of California, Irvine, USA and in the Institute of Computer Technology of TU Wien, Vienna, Austria.
I am also an adjunct professor (Docent) in embedded parallel and distributed computing in the Department of Future Technologies of University of Turku, Turku, Finland.



I received my Ph.D. from the IT department at University of Turku, Finland, and my M.Sc. from ECE department at University of Tehran.
I also received my MBA jointly from Turku School of Economics and European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) Digital.
I worked as a visiting researcher in the department of Industrial and Medical Electronics of KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden (2/15-2/16).
I am the recipient of the UCI Beall Applied Innovationâ€™s inaugural Faculty Innovation Fellowship, Nokia Foundation's Research Excellence Award (2 consecutive years), Ulla Tuominen Foundation's research excellence award, UTU's Teacher of the Year candidate, UTU's Rector awarded life-time Docent title,
and the European Union's awarded Global Marie Curie Fellowship. 



 

My research is in medical cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and e-health.
My work spans ubiquitous computing, wearable technology, applied machine learning, bio-signal processing, health informatics, and fog/edge computing.
I am especially excited about novel sensing, computation, analytics, informatics, communication, and networking paradigms, applied to healthcare and wellbeing applications.
