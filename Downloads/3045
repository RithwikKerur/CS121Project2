    				Vacation (?) in  Germany    			


For the last one week, I have been in Germany.Â  Berlin, Hamburg, Memmingen, and now Munich.Â  SOme of this is very nostalgic — met some friends like Leela after 30 years.Â  ANd some has been hectic sightseeing trips.Â  Now I am on the last leg of this trip which was primarily to attend wedding of two very close friends– Susanne Boll and Utz Westermann.Â  Will say more on that soon.
I always love being in Germany and this trip has been no exception.Â  Very soon I will create some events in Seraja and share here.Â  In fact this trip has been so hectic that I did not get much time to get on Internet at all.Â  So this is really not a vacation, but has been good.
