A. Jobs-- How has computerization
affected the number of jobs?
1. Loss of jobs has to be expected--
If companies buy IT to increase productivity,
have to expect loss of jobs to cut
costs of production
2. Gain of jobs
In IT companies
Hardware, Software, Internet, Consulting
What if IT cuts costs and prices are
cut,
Increase in demand could create jobs
Will this shift jobs
between companies in same industry
or increase jobs overall in economy?
 
3. Current data
Very low rate of unemployment
High rate of spending on technology
So--computerization must be good for
employment!
(Remember the productivity story)
 
4. Changing jobs, changing skills
So computerization can increase overall
employment
But computerization changes world,
so
Who should be responsible for retraining,
relocating?
How are you going to keep up with changing
world?
 
B. Nature of work-- How has computerization
affected the nature of work?
1. Deskilling of some jobs
People converted to machine operators
Skill elements of jobs have been reduced
or removed
2. Upgrading of other jobs
Does IT mean fewer, brighter people
in work force?
People have to understand IT
IT jobs can be very interesting
People have to learn to use data IT
makes available
 
3. Do all people want their jobs upgraded?
Do all people want to be creative on
the job?
Do some people want to do their job
to earn a living so that they
can get their excitement from other
pursuits?
The academic argument
Scientific management
Hawthorne experiments
Reality considerations
 
4. Today's world--employer-employee
relationships
Cannot expect to stay with an organization
for a lifetime
Fast changing world. No commitments
on either side.
Best you can expect is an opportunity
to learn new skills
and get new experiences
Have to manage your own career
Not like the military or
Old style organizations
Big increase in use of temps and part-timers
Is telecommuting a factor?
affecting relationships?
 
C. Wages-- How has computerization
affected wages?
Down--until recently--last couple of
years--
wages have not shared in economic growth
money used for other things
Now labor shortage and
concern over lack of wage growth(?)
have changed things
Some growth in unionization
Up--
for highly skilled people
for high level management
 
D. Computer people
Good Bad
Smart Narrow focus
Motivated Other relationships suffer
Money Take money and run (?)
Optimistic Not always realistic
Tech oriented Not people oriented
 
E. Computer Organizations
Characteristics Problems
Risk takers High failure rate
First product Second product
Managers are Keeping up w/change
techies
Major successes Major failures
Creative Not-invented-here is bad
Standards Don't share, e.g., Apple
Leadership Can pioneers manage?
Get job done Seems messy
eat hot dogs, but
don't look inside
