    				Wealth as cure for India’s Caste bias    			


NYT has a very interesting article about Dalits in India.
It is about a transformation taking place in India:
Mr. Prasad was born into the Pasi community, once considered untouchable on the ancient Hindu caste order. Today, a chain-smoking, irrepressible didact, he is the rare outcaste columnist in the English language press and a professional provocateur. His latest crusade is to argue that Indiaâ€™s economic liberalization is about to do the unthinkable: destroy the caste system. The last 17 years of new capitalism have already allowed his people, or Dalits, as they call themselves, to â€œescape hunger and humiliation,â€ he says, if not residual prejudice. 
There is some truth to this.  Prosperity in a society usually helps in killing some social problems.  Also, urbanization helps people just people — their history or caste does not travel with them if they don’t want it to.
