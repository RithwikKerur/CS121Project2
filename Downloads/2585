    				Towards TelePresence    			


People always have a dream of beingat remote places and participating in activities as if they are there.  All the teleTECHs are suppose to take us close to that and infact have been slowly taking us there.  Video conferencing was suppose to be a major step in that direction.  Due to many technical limitations the evolution of video conferencing and related tools have been slow.
I just saw this news release describing a major step in improving the quality of video conferencing in the next generation.  This is definitely a major step towards telepresence.  You can get all the details of this technology at

Now if you combine this with Multiple Perspective Interactive Video and Immersive Video, you get one step closer to ‘better than being there’.
