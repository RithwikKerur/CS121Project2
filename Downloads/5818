UCI researchers link compulsive Facebook checking to lack of sleep

February 4, 2016


Study correlates tiredness, bad mood, distractibility and social media browsing

Daily Sabah: “Facebook celebrates turning 12 with ‘Friends Day’” (Mark quoted)

February 3, 2016


In another study also released Wednesday, researchers at the University of California Irvine linked a lack of sleep with compulsive Facebook checking. With funding from the National Science Foundation, the report showed a direct connection between chronic lack of sleep, a worsening mood and an increased dependence on browsing Facebook.
Also, because they used Facebook more, participants were less productive.
“When you get less sleep, you’re more prone to distraction,” lead researcher Gloria Mark said in a statement. “If you’re being distracted, what do you do? You go to Facebook. It’s lightweight, it’s easy, and you’re tired.”

NPR: “Get A Grip On Your Information Overload With ‘Infomagical’” (Mark mentioned)

January 26, 2016


In a survey of 1,800 Note to Self listeners earlier this month, nearly 80 percent of respondents told us that sometimes they get headaches, insomnia or eye twitches as a result of information overload — but they still continue consuming more.
Gloria Mark, informatics professor at the University of California, Irvine, has found that the habit is a self-perpetuating cycle.
She uses sensors — Fitbit-like “acto-graphs,” lightweight cameras, heart rate monitors and regular “probes” — to measure how our bodies and emotions react when we spend time online. And her lab’s findings have been fairly consistent: Interruptions stress us out and keep us from properly concentrating, which stresses us out further, disrupting our concentration further, and on and on.

Los Angeles Times: “Hi, I’m a digital junkie, and I suffer from infomania” (Mark quoted)

January 19, 2016


Professor Gloria Mark at UC Irvine’s Department of Informatics recently completed study that suggests that the less sleep we get, the shorter our attention span is on any computer screen the next day – and the more likely we are to gravitate toward social media. “If you’re really tired,” she said, “you’re not really mentally prepared to do heavy-duty work. You tend to do lightweight activities like Facebook.”

Kobsa receives Mercator Fellowship

January 7, 2016


Informatics professor Alfred Kobsa has received a Mercator Fellowship from the German Research Foundation (DFG), the largest research funding organization in Germany. The Mercator fellowship will enable Kobsa—whose research focuses on the areas of user modeling and personalized systems, privacy, support for personal health maintenance, and information visualization—to participate in “intensive, long-term project-based collaboration between researchers from both domestic and foreign institutions,” according to the DFG. Throughout the duration of the fellowship, Kobsa will work both on-site at a German institution and continue his project collaboration here in Irvine. “Foreign Mercator Fellowship holders are awarded the title of Mercator Fellows in recognition of their dedication,” the DFG notes.

The Atlantic: “The triumph of email” (Mark mentioned)

January 6, 2016


White-collar workers check their inboxes an average of 77 times a day, according to research by Gloria Mark, an informatics professor at the University of California, Irvine. (If that sounds low to you, she found some workers check email far more frequently, up to 343 times a day or more.) The more time people spend focused on email, Mark has found, the less happy and productive they are.

Contra Costa Times:  “University of California pressured to count computer science toward high school math requirement” (Richardson quoted)

December 14, 2015


In the long run, perhaps UC should consider creating another category of courses that includes engineering and computer science, said Debra Richardson, founding dean of UC Irvine’s School of Information and Computer Sciences and chairwoman of the alliance. “It may be just as important for students to be conversant in computer science as in algebra. So many things rely on computers now.”
