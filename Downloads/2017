Preferences for access keys and edit form

This page can be used as template for (personal) preferences, or set as default site preference (see below).


  # Access keys - hold Alt (Windows IE), Shift + Alt (Firefox)
  # or Control (Mac) and tap the indicated key on your keyboard
  # to trigger the corresponding action.
#  'ak_view'          => '' ,         # view page
  'ak_edit'          => 'e',         # edit page
  'ak_history'       => 'h',         # page history
#  'ak_print'         => '',          # print view of page
  'ak_recentchanges' => 'c',         # Recent Changes
  'ak_save'          => 's',         # save page
  'ak_saveedit'      => 'u',         # save and keep editing
  'ak_savedraft'     => 'd',         # save as draft
  'ak_preview'       => 'p',         # preview page
  'ak_textedit'      => ','          # focus to edit textarea (at the end)
  'ak_em'            => 'i',         # emphasized text (italic)
  'ak_strong'        => 'b',         # strong text (bold)

#  'ak_attach'        => '',          # attach a file
#  'ak_backlinks'     => '',          # show backlinks
#  'ak_logout'        => '',          # log out

  # Editing components
  'e_rows' => '20',                  # rows in edit textarea
  'e_cols' => '70',                  # columns in edit textarea
  'Site.EditForm' => 'Site.EditForm' # location of EditForm

To create personal user (browser) preferences,
make a copy of this page somewhere, preferably as Profiles.insert_your_name_here-Preferences
edit that page with your new preferred settings,
select Set Preferences of this Page on the page containing your newly created settings. 
This sets a preference cookie on your browser which tells PmWiki where to find your personal preference settings.
To revert to the PmWiki default preferences
select Revert to PmWiki Default Preferences to unset the preference cookie
See also Cookbook:UserConfigurations about how to customise the edit form for personal use.

Note that by default, parsing of Site.Preferences is disabled. To make it the default site preference, add
 XLPage('prefs', "Site.Preferences");
to a config file (e.g. local/config.php).

To disable user preferences entirely set $EnablePrefs = 0;
