    				Vloggercon    			


The second conference on Vlogging took place in San Fran — see a report in News.com by Michelle Meyers.   It was attended by 350 people.  It seems that now there are more than 5000 vloggers.
With improvement in tools to upload and download video, it is expected that vlogging is going to take off very fast.  A good thing about vlogging will be that it could be made relatively independent of the language.  A video prepared by a Chinese farmer could still be used by a Somalian farmer.
