WICS Fall Quarter Week 5: Mentorship Reveal 

 11/08/201811/08/2018admin



The long-awaited mentorship reveal finally took place on Monday, October 29th. As our mentorship theme this year is Pokemon, mentors and mentees started off their adventure with a given slip of paper with a hint about their family type and three letters from their assigned Pokemon. They went around the room to find their family poster among the 15 different family types and then they tried to guess their Pokemon with the given letters. To earn more letters in their Pokemon’s name, they had to battle one of the gym leaders in a game of rock-paper-scissors. If they got lost, mentors and mentees were able to visit the Pokemon Center and receive guidance from either Nurse Chey or Officer Sharon.
This Pokemon-themed reveal was a lot of fun for mentors and mentees to find each other. Once paired up, families stayed to exchange contact information and to learn more about one another. Some families even went to UTC afterwards to hangout even more. We hope that all mentors and mentees had a memorable time at our mentorship reveal and we are excited to hear about how mentors and mentees will grow together from here on out! We also hope to see all the amazing pairings at the Mentee And Me Academic Planning event during week 8!
