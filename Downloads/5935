Research Philosophy
I am a mixture of researcher, scholar, teacher, designer, artist, tinker, maker, and activist. I see these practices as fundamentally interconnected. My work uses a diverse range of technologies and media to better understand the emerging possibilities for digital storytelling as a tool for expanding people’s experiential and phenomenological horizons. I am interested in the poetics of these experiences: how do we create participatory narrative experiences to produce a compelling sense of immersion, agency, and transformation? What aspects of a mediated experience change how their players/viewers see the world and their own place in it? How do we develop and evaluate new poetics for what I call Transformative Play? I am generally fascinated by systems that give people a chance to experience a sense of identity transformation, perspective taking, and role play. My lab is multidisciplinary, combining design research methods, close readings of games, and artistic practice and production. My design work often bridges digital and physical systems: I use interactive tangible user interfaces, computationally augmented costumes, and responsive physical environments to create prototype interactive narrative experiences that explore my theoretical ideas. I have a background in theater and music, and so I draw on techniques from method actor training and the performing arts in addition to current theory and practice in human computer interaction (HCI) and digital interactive narrative (DIN) studies. Lately I have been describing my work as the design and study of playful XR1 experiences at the intersection of theater, games, storytelling, and design. The purpose of my research is to understand how experiences of identity transformation and role-play within mediated experiences can empower people to envision and realize better futures for themselves and the world. By designing and studying digital storytelling systems that produce experiences of role-taking and identity shift, my work aspires to create possibilities for social and individual change. I know all too well how the identities that we inhabit in the world are contingent and negotiated. Transformative play uses techniques from games, theater, and human computer interaction to carve out moments for personal transformation, empowerment, and change. These experiences of transformative theatrical play have a profound power to create possibility models that are emancipatory. When we inhabit new identities, we create possibilities where there were none before. We restory our lives into new configurations that allow us to reclaim lost power. My aspiration for transformative play is as a mechanism for the radical empowerment of marginalized and oppressed peoples. It has taken years of exploration, tinkering, reflection, collaboration, and creation to move transformative play from a purely theoretical idea to a robust research and design practice, capable of being brought to bear on the hard problems of inequity, discrimination, and oppression that our society is struggling with. Transformative play is a “big idea” that I will spend a lifetime trying to pin down, but it is also a simple idea: that people need to be able to imagine themselves into better futures before they are able to create those futures. That participating in digital storytelling experiences can help people to transform their perspective and create new narratives that have the power to bring about positive change in the world.
“Traditional Bio”
Dr. Theresa Jean Tanenbaum (“Tess”) is a game designer, artist, maker, and assistant professor in the Department of Informatics at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California-Irvine where she is a founding member of the Transformative Play Lab. She received her PhD from the School of Interactive Arts + Technology at Simon Fraser University. Dr. Tanenbaum is a transgender woman, whose work is engaged with issues of gender, identity, and narrative. Dr. Tanenbaum’s work is playful, provocative, and interdisciplinary, frequently straddling the line between art, design, and research. Her doctoral research examined identity transformation and empathy in digital narratives and games, drawing on theories and methodologies from the performing arts and human-computer-interaction.  Her research draws on insights from digital interactive narrative, digital games, social justice, design fiction, futures studies, and extended reality theater. Her ongoing work on “Transformative Play” draws on techniques from theater practice to create and explore playful experiences that communicate different perspectives on the world, encouraging players to viscerally inhabit new identities and experiences. Her first book, edited in collaboration with Magy Seif El-Nasr and Michael Nixon, entitled Nonverbal Communication in Virtual Worlds: Understanding and Designing Expressive Characters was released in early 2014 by Carnegie Mellon Universities ETC Press. She also served as a consulting researcher at the Nokia Chief Technology Office’s Advanced Engineering group where she advised on matters of storytelling and wearable technology for the Internet of Things.  An experienced game designer, Tess’s work incorporates physical objects, wearable technology, and interactive tabletops to explore embodied interactions with digital games and stories. She has developed new gaming technologies that push the boundaries of personal fabrication, using 3D printers and laser cutters as platforms for hybrid digital/physical games.  Her recent game, Magia Transformo: The Dance of Transformation, was an official selection of IndieCade: the largest festival of independent games in the world. It uses costumes and movement to help players adopt the personas of witches and warlocks to uncover the secret magical history of the world. Tess is also a “Steampunk” artist, and maker, whose work on DiY culture appears in the book Vintage Tomorrows and the documentary film of the same name.Her recent design work explores the intersection of live performance and MR/AR/VR technologies.  Collaborating with Tim Kashani of Apples and Oranges Arts, she has mentored students in experimental designs for VR theater experiences, including a student team that took second place in the 2018 Butterworth Product development competition.  She is currently developing Virtual Reality systems that transform how we think about creative practice in the performing arts. These include ShadowCast, a VR networked theatrical performance platform (created in collaboration with Tim Kashani), and VirDAW, a VR digital audio workstation (created in collaboration with UCI Drama Professor Vincent Olivieri). She is the recipient of an Epic MegaGrant along with collaborator’s Tawny Schlieski of Shovels + Whiskey, Juliette Levy of UC Riverside,  and Thomas Winsor and Pip Brignal of Reality Check Productions to develop a new location based interactive storytelling platform called alt: inspired by the idea of exploring the material record of alternate realities.
Activism and Service
Much of my service to the field is related to issues of diversity and inclusion. I am one of fourteen founding members appointed to SIGCHI CARES, a volunteer group that serves as a resource for those who experience discrimination and/or harassment while participating in Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction (SIGCHI) events, activities, and publications. CHI is the largest special interest group (SIG) in my main field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and the CARES committee serves as a listening body and first response group for any member of the community in need of a confidential and supportive ear. CARES members were selected for our reputations as champions of diversity and inclusivity and our visibility within the community. Our role is to first to listen and provide support and, as needed, to help victims of discrimination and harassment access and navigate the appropriate resources for seeking a remedy within the ACM organization. I also serve on the board of the QueerHCI SIG, where I focus on identifying policy challenges around LGBTQ+ identities within the ACM and SIGCHI organizations and developing remedies. In this capacity I have been working on advocating for more trans inclusive policies within the ACM. When a transgender scholar changes their name, they are often faced with an impossible choice: to abandon their previous scholarship, or to forever be haunted by their pre-transition identity. I refused to accept this situation. I joined an ACM working group in June of 2019 to help develop a trans inclusive name change policy for the ACM Digital Library. Working with two other volunteers, I led the writing and revision process of a new policy that was adopted by the ACM in November of 2019. This policy, the first of its kind to be adopted by a major publisher, allows transgender authors to correct their names on previously published work. Since the adoption of this policy, I have continued to serve on an implementation committee working to solve the practical and logistical challenges around support these requests while helping the ACM meet their legal obligations as the largest publisher of computing research in the world. The experience I have gained advocating for trans rights within the ACM has given me a platform for pushing for more trans inclusive policies worldwide. I have been advising the director of Journals, Policy, & Strategy at Springer in the creation of an inclusive name change policy for their entire publishing catalog, and I recently published a worldview article in Nature advocating for these policies in the academic publishing world. I was also interviewed in The Scientist about the work I have done at ACM on name change policies. These articles helped advance the conversation within the publishing world, resulting in multiple editorial boards expressing their intention to adopt such policies. Recently, I founded a cross-disciplinary Trans Inclusive Name Change Policy Working Group to coordinate our efforts.  Many of us have joined a working group at the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) where we are currently working to issue guidance to the almost 13,000 member publishers and journals who look to this body for rulings on issues of integrity, fairness, and ethics in publishing practices. My working group has also released a white paper that documents the common arguments and objections faced by transgender scholars when we seek to correct our scholarly records and roadmaps how to respond to them, so that other trans people working in academia have a resource for their own advocacy. I also serve on the board of the Association of Research into Digital Interactive Narrative (ARDIN), where I am the Diversity and Inclusion Chair, working to develop policies to support our diverse community of scholars and creators at the conferences that ARDIN organizes.
