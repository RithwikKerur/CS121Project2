WICS Winter Quarter Week 3: VMware Info Session 

 01/26/201901/28/2019admin



On January 23rd 2019, WICS had the pleasure of meeting engineers and recruiters from VMWare at our VMWare info session. About 30 general members came, including many graduate students and students who have never been to a WICS event before! The event comprised of a presentation, which allowed us to learn more about VMWare. They shared their 12 innovation areas of focus, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and adaptive security. In addition, they told us about their programs for full-time and internships. At the end, the students had a chance to talk one-on-one with the workers from VMWare to ask additional questions and share their resume. Even though only a small number of us initially knew about VMWare, we all left with outstanding knowledge about the company and a VMWare shirt! One lucky student even left with an Echo Spot, after winning the raffle. We would like to give a huge thanks to VMWare for coming out and teaching us about their company!
