“If I have seen farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of my colleagues.”
Ramesh was fortunate to work with several very talented students at different stages in their and his career. He owes much of his contributions to collaborations and interactions with his students. Many of them finished their doctorate and are listed as doctoral students. Some of the students mentored by him decided to not finish their doctorate and do exciting things and have accomplished great success. They are also listed below with their contributions.
