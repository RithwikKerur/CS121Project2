    				Situation Awareness and Control    			


In the last few years, many research fields have started addressing issues in Situation Awareness.  A problem has been that there is no good definition of Situation and hence it becomes difficult to understand and use it.
Recently, Vivek Singh (a doctoral student working with me) started addressing this issue rigorously and determination to define and use it.  Since the problem is a difficult one, it will take some time to make strong progress, but he has already taken a strong step in right direction.  He will be presenting a paper on this soon at Micom2009.
His paper gives a good introduction to Situation and its use in controling emerging Cyber Physical and other systems.  The paper is available here.
