    				Close to normal at home    			


After this week end, things are close to normal — at least 80% there — in terms of moving.  I can find most things that I need.  This does feel good.
The best thing about this home is the commute to work.  Living in Orange County of California and driving to work where I face 4 stop signs and no traffic lights!!!  Can you beat that?  I could walk to work — about 10 minutes walk on the way to work, but return will be uphill so I may do it only occassionally.
We even had non-family member guests to visit our home yesterday.
