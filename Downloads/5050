WICS Spring Quarter Week 10: Amazon Alexa Wokshop 

 06/05/201908/21/2019admin



On Monday, June 3rd, WICS had Amazon representatives host an Amazon Alexa Workshop. The engineers guided everyone through the process of creating a skill for Alexa! The skill that we were creating would allow us to ask Alexa: “Who is Pokemon 25?” or variations of that question. There were some bumps along the way for most people when creating the skill, but the Amazon engineers were very helpful, making sure that everyone had a chance to complete the workshop. In the end, most attendees were able to create a successful skill for Alexa!
