Professor Tsudik Receives SRC Grant for Research on Security of Low-End IoT Devices
November 8, 2019 
Distinguished Professor of Computer Science Gene Tsudik received a grant from the Semiconductor Research Corp. (SRC) in the amount of $270,000 for a project titled: “Formally Verified Remote Attestation and Related Services for Low-End IoT Devices.” It is funded through the SRC’s Trustworthy and Secure Semiconductors and Systems (T3S) program. The project aims to develop a first-of-its-kind suite of formally verified basic security services for low-end embedded, Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical system (CPS) devices. Such services include remote attestation, memory erasure, device reset, as well as software update and code execution. Proposed research will use “state-of-the-art automated formal verification tools” and will produce “detailed design specs for each service,” along with a functional prototype implementation of each service.

SRC is a consortium of major computer manufacturers that funds, among other things, academic research. Its funding selection process is highly competitive.
