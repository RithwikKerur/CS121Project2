June 18, 2020


“Dreams of the Overworked: Living, Working & Parenting in the Digital Age” is a new book by Melissa Mazmanian, UCI associate professor of informatics, and Christine Beckman, professor of public policy at the University of Southern California. In this episode of the UCI Podcast, Mazmanian, who holds appointments in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences and the Paul Merage School of Business, discusses her process of writing the book and how it relates to our lives in this time of global pandemic.
 




A New Perspective on Technology and the Realities of Work-Life Balance

June 11, 2020


Melissa Mazmanian and Christine Beckman’s new book detailing technology use by nine families explores how working parents navigate today’s digital world.

University of California News: “Newly funded COVID-19 research aims to protect the most vulnerable” (Sean Young quoted)

June 5, 2020


This week, UC announced the successful completion of a whirlwind effort to award $2 million in seed funding to research across the state aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19, particularly among those at greater risk for infection and adverse outcomes. Sean Young of UC Irvine, who was awarded seed funding, has been working on health interventions for a long time, most recently among African American and Latinx men at high risk for AIDS. His project, HOPE (Harnessing Online Education), is a 12-week online community intervention designed to change risky behavior. With funding from UC, Young’s goal is to go back to this most recent HIV awareness cohort, and offer them a chance to take a survey to address some of their concerns and risks around the coronavirus, and learn how to create a new online community intervention to reduce their risks about COVID-19.
