    				Visual Search    			


Youtube acquisition has made visual search hot again.Â  WSJ has an article today (Subscription required).
But in recent weeks, a host of new search services have taken aim at the problem, and the $1.65 billion marriage of Google and YouTube — leaders in Web search and Web video, respectively — is likely to spur even more innovation that will yield more accurate and relevant results.
..
Now, video-search engines are trying to improve their results by trying new imaging and speech-recognition technologies and broadening their scope with new partnerships.
Interesting challenges.Â  Soon I will be attending ACM Multimedia Conference in which video search is a major research area and top researchers come to that.Â  Will be interesting to see their reaction and ideas.
