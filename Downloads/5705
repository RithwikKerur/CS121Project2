Cutting costs
 
 
I. Access
 
E-mail is Biggest Activity on Internet
Loss leader for ISP's--zero cost
Wireless e-mail appliance (Reference 5)
for those who need to be connected always
Two recent actions to increase usage
Organizational offerings
Free PC's
Organizational reactions to usage
 
 
 
Organizational offerings (NY Times, 13 Feb)
 
Ford Offering each of its 350,000 employees
A computer, printer, and unlimited access
for $5 per month
Delta, 80,000 employees, similar,
but not quite as generous
  --------------------------------------------------

Why is Ford doing this?
 
Increasing computer literacy
Some concern that Ford will use it
for other reasons, e.g.,
disseminate information to employees
get people to work from home
stifle anti-Ford messages
 
Free (or almost free) PC's
 
for signing up for internet service
for providing information
---------------------------------------------------
Organizational restrictions on access (Reference 1)
 
"... 10% of the work force, were fired
for sending e-mail that violated standards
at the NY Times Co.'s business office
[in Norfolk, Virginia]."
employees had sent or forwarded
"potentially offensive e-mails"
  ----------------------------------------------------

NY Times had rules about e-mail:
 
"... computer communications must be
consistent with conventional standards
of ethical and proper conduct, behavior and
manners and are not to be used to create,
forward or display any offensive or
disruptive messages, including photographs,
graphics and audio materials."
 
Management Looked at files
Monitored e-mail
Why did this happen?
No likely employee defense
-----------------------------------------------------------
II. Matching
One of the major goals of e-mail and
electronic communication in general is
matching
 
Matching customers with products
Matching people of like interests
Matching prospective partners
Cutting costs
-------------------------------------------------
 
Dating sites (References 4 and 6)
 
Over 1200 on the Web
Valentine's day articles in LA Times and Time
Match.com has grown from
300,000 members in 1997 to
2.5 million today
100,000 active members
Why are dating sites so popular?
 
Really started in France
Honesty and frankness in e-mail
Old fashioned courting--talk, no touching
Beats single bars
AOL and gay chat rooms (Time sidebar)
------------------------------------------------------
Auction sites
 
Retail
Business-to-business
---------------------------------------------------------

E-Communities
Etzioni article (Reference 7)
 
"Virtual communities cannot provide nearly
as much subtle and encompassing knowledge
of members as a real community. But they
can include many more people. One's strong
suit is depth, the other's is breadth."
 
 
 
"It seems that e-communities can reach the
highest level of intimacy only if all the
building blocks are in place:
the number of participants is kept
relatively small,
admission is controlled to foster affinity,
and people drop their internet masks."
--------------------------------------------------
III. Matching engines (Reference 8)
"The software does a statistical analysis
of the seeker's interests or communication
style, then sallies forth in search of someone
who appears to be compatible."
Yenta--
 
"... is designed to introduce its users to other
like-minded people at no cost to privacy."
Yenta to Yenta communication
"Cobot analyses transcripts of user interaction
from a chat room in LamdaMOO, an onlin community
that wa created in 1990 at Xerox's PARC laboratory
and is still popular among computer programmers."
Users check with Cobot to find out about themselves.
 
IV. Cutting costs--an example
WWW publishing (LA Times, NY Times)
faster dissemination
Cut costs, e.g., thesis publication
