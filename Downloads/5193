WICS Fall Quarter Week 1: First General Meeting 

 10/17/201810/17/2018admin



On October 1st, WICS hosted their first meeting of the new school year in DBH 6011! We had close to 200+ RSVPs and over 170 students attended. This is the biggest turn out that we ever had compared to our previous years. During this meeting, our co-presidents Princess Pancubit and Crystal Agerton, introduced WICS and the organization’s mission, introduced our new board members for the school year, explained ways general members can be involved and our upcoming events throughout the quarter. Before the event ended, we selected eight students to receive swag bags by doing a raffle that they received for simply attending the meeting. We had a great start to the new school year and we hope to see this many people at our upcoming events!
