Welcome to the webpage for Prof. Alexander Ihler's Statistical Learning and Inference group at UCI.

We are interested in using probabilistic models to represent and understand real-world phenomena, using approximation algorithms to estimate probabilistic quantities efficiently, and learning probabilistic models from data.  We focus primarily on algorithms for learning and estimation in graphical models, with applications to sensor networks, data mining, image processing and computer vision, and computational biology.
