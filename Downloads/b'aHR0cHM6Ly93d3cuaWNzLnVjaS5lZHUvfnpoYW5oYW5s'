About




          I am a 3 rd year Ph.D. student in computer science at UC Irvine 
          advised with Professor Shuang Zhao 
          and Professor Michael T. Goodrich.          
        

          My research interest is in physicaly-based rendering, with focus 
          on sound rendering. That is to simulate sound propagation and model sound 
          interactions with object surfaces.
        

          Before becoming a Ph.D. student, I obtained my M.S. in computer science 
          from University of California, Irvine (2016-2018), and B.S. in 
          computer science and technology (railway information technology) from 
          Beijing Jiaotong University (2012-2016).
        

          I enjoy learning and doing sport when I am not doing research.
