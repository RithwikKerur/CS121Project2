Cyber@UCI: Club’s Growing Cybersecurity Community Develops Third-Place Team

April 15, 2019


In 2017, when the Cyber@UCI student club was just starting out, computer science major and founding club president Howard Chen noted in an article, “in two years, I want Cyber to be an official ICS club and I want a competitive cybersecurity team operating out of UCI.” Fast forward to 2019, and Cyber@UCI is not only an official club of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), but its National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team advanced to the Western Regional Championship for the first time and took third place overall!

Alumni Spotlight: Gerald Bortis Helps Transform Healthcare

April 9, 2019



By the end of high school, Gerald Bortis knew he wanted to study computer science at UCI. He joined the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) and earned his B.S. in 2005. He had already decided to continue his education when he received a job offer from the company he worked with for his capstone project. Rather than choose between industry and academia, he earned his M.S. in ICS in 2007 and his Ph.D. in software engineering in 2016, all while working as a software engineer at Mirth. Through his work, he quickly recognized the power of technology to transform the healthcare industry; through his education, he gained the knowledge necessary to help realize that transformation. As vice president of software development at NextGen Healthcare, Bortis now leads teams in developing systems that manage electronic health records and that aggregate and share healthcare data. The School of ICS recognized his achievements and positive influence on healthcare in February, inducting him into the ICS Hall of Fame.

Merage School of Business: “UCI Stock Market Competition Makes Financial Literacy a Top Priority for Undergraduate Students” (Informatics student YuHeng Li second place winner)

April 5, 2019



In the UCI Stock Market Competition, students have the opportunity to learn about trading –– how to formulate trading strategies, execute trades and learn from wins and losses. In addition, the workshops teach both basic and advanced investing, information about the investment industry and how to invest when students land their first job.

Student Success on Display at Winter 2019 Informatics Project Showcase

April 1, 2019


“Students, you have survived!” André van der Hoek, chair of the Department of Informatics, cheered students at the Winter Informatics Student Project Showcase on March 18, 2019, applauding their completion of the two-quarter capstone course. He then thanked the sponsors for providing this opportunity for students to build their resumes and put their education to practical use. “I’m forever grateful for all the capstone sponsors,” he said. He highlighted that this experience lets students walk into an interview and say, “not only did I take these courses, but I took the capstone and was working with real clients in real situations and encountering real challenges, and here’s how I personally overcame these challenges.” He explained how that narrative can be the difference between merely landing an interview and actually landing the job.

Grants for New Informatics Professors Support Health and Children’s Literacy

March 27, 2019


Two of the newest faculty members in the Department of Informatics were recently awarded grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSF’s Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) aims to help beginning investigators establish their research programs. Daniel Epstein and Stacy Branham, both of whom joined the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) as assistant professors in Fall 2018, each received $175,000 to fund their proposed research. Epstein’s work supports food journaling, while Branham’s focuses on improving children’s literacy skills. Both awards fall under the NSF’s Cyber-Human Systems (CHS) program, demonstrating ICS’s continued excellence in human-computer interaction research.

Ph.D. Student Samantha McDonald Helps Us Better Connect with Congress

March 22, 2019



For the past two summers, Informatics Ph.D. student Samantha McDonald has been going to Washington, D.C., to work with different congressional nonprofits, learning what role technology can play in improving communication with constituents. “From my studies, I’ve found that the primary technology inside Congress right now is databases called CRMs, or constituent relations management systems,” says McDonald. CRMs can monitor the number of people calling and the issues discussed, but they don’t create substantive engagement. “They’re taking the temperature of the district, seeing if people are getting heated up about certain topics,” she explains, “so it’s more of a way to track emotions than to engage constituents [and] recognize them as legitimate actors in policymaking.”

UCI News Applied Innovation: “AVIAA Spreads Wings into Irvine and Beyond” (Gillian Hayes quoted)

March 19, 2019


Gillian Hayes experienced a migratory life growing up, as her parents would move the family from state to state pursuing careers in academia at universities. After landing in Athens, Georgia, she discovered her talent for the Science-Technology-Engineering-Math (STEM) field. And, as her own academic career began to unfold, Hayes eventually found herself with a fateful internship at the National Institutes of Health’s AIDS laboratory that helped define her future when her cultures grew mold and didn’t yield the results they needed.

Variety: “The Problem of Toxicity in Esports (and Two Solutions)” (Informatics graduate student Amanda Cullen cited)




For Matthew Knutson and Amanda Cullen of UC Irvine, preventing toxicity in games begins with being prepared. The pair represented UCI’s esports program at GDC, and their half of the Diversity and Inclusion in Esports panel outlined their efforts to cultivate a welcoming environment.
