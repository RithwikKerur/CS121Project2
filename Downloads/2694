    				Academia and Visual Maps    			


Cyrus Shahabi at USC is doing a project that shows the future of how maps will be used in information systems.
He showed me the demo of this system about a month ago in Singapore at the ACM Multimedia conference.  Very impressive.
Here is an interesting article reporting his work.
