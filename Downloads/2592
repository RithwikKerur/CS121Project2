    				More on camera    			


I talked about Exilim S500 camera.  Today Randy Paul sent me a link to say that this camera is now a bargain and is available for as low as $329.  This indeed is a bargain.
More importantly, it suggests something very important — how fast this area is developing and hence how soon these devices will make visual media (both photos and videos) a real popular media.
