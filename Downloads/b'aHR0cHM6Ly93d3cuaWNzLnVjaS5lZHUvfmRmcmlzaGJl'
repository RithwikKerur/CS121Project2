About me
I am a PhD student in the theory group of the computer science department at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). I started at UCI in Fall 2018.
MS awarded Spring 2020. PhD expected Spring 2023.
See my CV for professional experience.
Research
My current and recent research includes rapidly mixing Markov chains; hierarchical clustering algorithms and their relationship to combinatorial optimization problems; a graph simplification problem; studying the graphs that arise from configurations in a game involving pegs and disks (Towers of Hanoi); and a problem motivated by drawing aesthetically pleasing (Lombardi) graphs.
