Master of Human-Interaction and Design (MHCID)


The Master of Human-Interaction and Design (MHCID) program at UC Irvine is a professional degree that prepares students to be the leaders of the future in human computer interaction, user experience design and research, product management, and more. This terminal degree should be undertaken by early and mid-career professionals and executives looking to take the next step in their careers.
This one-year program is unique in its innovative hybrid learning approach. Students spend time on campus in intensive in-person courses as well as online using the best in distance-based learning approaches and tools.
MHCID students also solve real-world problems in diverse teams that work closely with our award-winning interdisciplinary faculty. After mastering a range of key UX skills and subjects, graduates will gain important academic and practical experience through our capstone project course. Students will collaborate with an industry sponsor to innovate, improve, or modify a new or existing human-to-machine technology.
We graduate leading professionals who are designing the future and defining how people and technology engage. These professionals include directors of user experience, UX researchers, product managers, visual designers, and even CTOs.
