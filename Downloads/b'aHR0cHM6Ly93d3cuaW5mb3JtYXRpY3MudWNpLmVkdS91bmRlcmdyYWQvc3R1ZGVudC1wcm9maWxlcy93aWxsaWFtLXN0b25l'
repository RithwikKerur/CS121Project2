Computer Game Science
Why did you choose UCI for your studies?
Making video games was the only thing I could see myself doing for a living when I was in high school. Now that I’ve gone through the major I’ve been able to branch out a little more, but my passion is still with games.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
This major has given me a new interest in computer science, not just video games. I love learning about all the new technologies that have been coming out recently, like the Google Glass. It’s cool to see what crazy ideas people have been coming up with, and even cooler to know that I have the ability to develop software for them!
Have you done an internship?
I have not done an internship (though I’ve applied to quite a few now).
Have you done research?
I am currently working on a research project with professor André van der Hoek involving the Google Glass. The goal of the project is to make a tool which programmers on a team can use to be more aware of their teammates. I’ve done a number of things on the project, but the biggest ones were making a plugin for the Eclipse IDE to get information about what the programmer is working on, and actually programming the app for the Google Glass.
Are you pursuing a minor or double major?
I’m minoring in Political Science with a focus in Game Theory. Game Theory is the study of decision making. I chose it because I find the subject of Game Theory incredibly fascinating (I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in AI). It’s still requires logical thinking like computer science, but there’s no programming involved and sometimes I like to get a break from working on the computer.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
I’m the Design Director in the Video Game Development Club on campus. My role is to teach people the basics of video game design and to help mentor people. Sadly we can’t make joining the club a requirement for the major, but if you’re serious about making video games you should definitely join the club. A lot of the experience you get from making games in a club is something you just can’t get out of classes.
What are you most proud of so far?
Last year I did a game jam (make a game in 72 hours) with three other people. We managed to make a really intense arcade-like, space adventure game. Everyone who played the game had a blast playing it, and we won an award at IEEE GameSIG for “Most Novel Game”. Our game was also featured in a news article about the event.
What has been the best part of your experience?
I’ve had a great time getting to know everyone in the club and getting involved in the games industry. It’s great to see all the amazing ideas people can come up with, and see the potential we have going into the industry. Also, everyone’s been really great to hang out with when we aren’t involved with projects. If you need cool gamer friends, look no further!
What are your aspirations?
I want to start by getting a job as a designer at a video game company. I’m not too particular about what company at this stage in my career. Eventually I’d like to make my own games though, so maybe when I’m older I could get a job making internal software for a company and work on my own projects on the side.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
Don’t give up; this major is really hard in the beginning but after you get used to programming and being in college it gets a lot better (I won’t say easier, but at least more manageable). If you get stuck, ask people for help.
