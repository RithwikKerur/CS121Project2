Resources & Toolkits 



While the UNITE Project does not offer direct services or care at this time, we are proudly committed to sharing and referring to other community resources. If you are in crisis, please call 211 for Social Services+Support, 911 for Emergencies, and 1-800-273-TALK if you are suicidal or in need of urgent mental health support.
