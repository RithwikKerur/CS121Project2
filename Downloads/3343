My friend Dilip sent me a link to a very nice piece: If Content is King … Context is Kingdom ..
Really interesting piece.
I think Neil Clammons is right on target when he says

Itâ€™s where rational meets emotional and starts to drive the engagement we all desire.  Context provides meaning. And that meaning is extremely valuable. Probably more valuable than the content, in fact.

In my experience not only in user experience area (where Neil Clammons is coming from — just providing context to the above), but also in scientific analysis, context is essential.  Without context one can not analyze any data whether scientific or social analysis or user experience.  In the name of objectivity, analysts have given over-importance to content.  I am almost sure that increasingly context will receive more importance.

Interesting that right now there’s a special issue about “Integration of Context and Content for Multimedia Management” in IEEE Trans. on Multimedia, vol. 11, no. 2, Feb 2009

Thanks for pointing this out.  This is a good issue.

I love content and how it flows.  When writing we know that text is not the only way to communicate.  We now embed videos, slideshows, consumer polls and other types of widgets.
People once thought that video would be the only way, but my preference is text and image.
By the way, I did a case study with Google “taken out of context”, which gave my thoughts back in 2004.  Now we have google coming out with the new “cloud” system to kill the pc forever!

This is especially meaningful to anyone who routinely attempts to create content with  context that will appeal and attract others. Providing the proper context within your content is what makes it rich and something of value, as well as a challenge to the writer.
