This is about an automated pollen recognition system.
The system automatically scans a sample with various z-plane (focus),
detect pollen grains and segment them,
and recognize the species.


Dataset, models and writeup will be uploaded.


keywords: proposal detection, segmentation, detection, classification, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, multi-instance learning, fine-grained classification.
