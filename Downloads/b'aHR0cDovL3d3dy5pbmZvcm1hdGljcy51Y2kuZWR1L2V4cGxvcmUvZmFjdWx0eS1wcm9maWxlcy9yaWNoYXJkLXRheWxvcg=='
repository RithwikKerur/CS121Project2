More Structured Solutions
Central to the success of any software application is the development of a robust architecture. When it comes to designing large-scale systems, says Professor Richard Taylor, the proof is in the pudding. “Creating a new software architecture requires actual engineering and systems building to determine how well it will work in an industrial setting.” Through his research, Professor Taylor empowers software designers with advanced tools for making the decisions that shape a software system’s underlying structure.
Ecosystems of Ecommerce
Professor Taylor’s current focus is devising architectural styles directed at strongly decentralized applications, such as ecommerce systems. “For instance, if you buy a book from Amazon, you’re also interacting with a credit card processor, UPS and even a third party if Amazon itself isn’t the seller,” he says. “There’s a whole ecosystem of companies that fulfills your order.” The applications that let them do it are difficult to architect and subject to security risks; Professor Taylor’s work helps address these critical challenges.
Building a Better Web
Over the course of three decades, Professor Taylor has been a part of developing revolutionary technology that changes the way we live. Case in point: the World Wide Web. The brainchild of British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, the web’s design infrastructure — created in 1989 — began to unravel within the first four years. “At that point,” Professor Taylor says, “one of my students took it over and redesigned it. The foundations of the web today are in very large measure a product of UC Irvine. And we’re continuing to find innovative ways to make it better.”

“Designing software is like designing a building: You need the right architecture to make it functional, elegant and lasting.”
