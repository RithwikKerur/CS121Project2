    				Indians can not work together    			


January 22 issue of FORTUNE magazine has an article by Clay Chandler titled ‘Wireless Wonder’ on Sunil Mittal of Bharti Airtel.Â  Good article on Mittal but I found interesting that Sunil Mittal emphasizes ” It’s very hard for two Indians to partner well.” No wonder Mr. Mittal has partnered with international firms, had used reverse outsourcing to build his successful business and seems to be progressing further.
A factual mistake in the article– India flag does not have image of hand loom — that is congress flag.
