Spring 2022 Week 3: Movie Night 

 04/28/2022admin



On Monday April 11th, 2022, WICS held a movie night social for members to hang out in a casual space and get to know each other. We watched the new Disney movie Turning Red which details a preteen girl’s attempts to go to a concert amidst her mom’s meddling and adorable red pandas. Members seemed to really enjoy the movie as it was so relatable and there was definitely a lot of laughter throughout the room. The movie had a really sweet message of being true to yourself and accepting who you are which we always promote here at WICS especially when entering new spaces like the tech industry!
