Faculty Spotlight: Crista Lopes Creates Startup to Reimagine Virtual Conferences

March 10, 2022



In 2020, the knowledge and expertise of Crista Lopes converged to meet the moment. The professor of software engineering in UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) had just co-authored the Communications of the ACM article, “Conferences in an Era of Expensive Carbon,” so she was already exploring the future of conferences when the global pandemic hit. She quickly pivoted to help draft “Virtual Conferences: A Guide to Best Practices” and worked to move the 42nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) online. Drawing from her wealth of experience as an early developer of OpenSimulator — and her involvement with the OpenSimulator Community Conference (OSCC), which has occurred virtually since 2013 — she worked with Professor Jon Bell of Northeastern University and Professor Benjamin Pierce from the University of Pennsylvania to code a new platform called Clowdr. Their innovative open source project for climate friendly, accessible virtual and hybrid conferences now serves as the basis for a startup company that operates the platform as a service called Midspace. Here, Lopes talks about her experience in developing this new project and bridging the academic-industry divide.
