    				Back Home    			


After spending two days in meetings in Singapore, I am back in Irvine.  Currently jetlagged but very excited to be back.  Lots of good things seem to be lining up.  The first good news I got was that an article that I wrote may be a cover feature of IEEE Computer Magazine for their February issue.  This article will be on EventWeb and will cover lot of my research.  So this is a good recognition and publicity.
Our classes begin on Monday.  That will also keep me busy.  After this term, I don;t have to teach in Spring and then in summer.  So I will have 6 free months to focus on research.
