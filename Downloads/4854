Fall Quarter 2017 Week 1: WICS First General Meeting 

 10/05/201711/08/2017Diana Sandil



On Monday, October 2nd WICS held their first General Meeting in DBH 6011. This meeting had about 200+ RSVPs and over 100 students attend. It was the biggest turn out that we ever had anticipated compared to previous years. During this meeting, our co-presidents, Katie Yeh and Ericca Go, introduced our board members, explained what the purpose of what our clubs was and what kind of events we hold. We also had our internal vice president, Alice Wen, talk about the mentorship program and the mentorship mixer we were gonna have next week. Before the meeting ended, we selected several students to receive swag by doing a raffle.  It was definitely great to start off the new year with meeting everyone! We hope to see this many people at our next event!
