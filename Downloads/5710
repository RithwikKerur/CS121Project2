How Information Technologies Can Transform Organizations
1. 	IT is Enabling Fundamental Changes 
		in the Way Work is Done
	Travel--Letting consumers do their own searching, 
	i.e., who does what
	Auto--Making it easier to compare prices;
	Offloading sales and closing activities
 
2. 	IT is Enabling the Integration of Business Functions 
		at All Levels within and between Organizations
	Travel--consumer into electronic market
	Auto--vertical integration
	dealers want to sell on web
	web info sources what to sell cares

It is Causing Shifts in the Competitive Climate in 


Many Industries

 
	Travel--better info should provide more competition
	Auto--same
 
4. 	It Presents New Strategic Opportunities for 	

Organizations That Reassess Their 

		Missions and Operations
	Travel--agencies have to find a role
	web guys and providers taking over traditional agency role
 
	Auto--everybody trying to figure out 
	what their role will be
	Big fights over turf
	Role of cars made to order
 
5.	Successful Application of IT Will Require Changes
	in Management and Organizations Structure
	we covered this before in Productivity discussion
 
6.	A Major Challenge for Management in the 1990's
	Will Be to Lead Their Organizations through the
	Transformation Necessary to Prosper in the
	Globally Competitive Environment
