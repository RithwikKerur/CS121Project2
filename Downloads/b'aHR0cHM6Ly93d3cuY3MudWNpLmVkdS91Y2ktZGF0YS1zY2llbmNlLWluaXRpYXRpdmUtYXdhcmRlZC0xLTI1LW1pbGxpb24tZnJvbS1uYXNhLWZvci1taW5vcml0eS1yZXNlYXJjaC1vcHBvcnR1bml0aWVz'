UCI Data Science Initiative awarded $1.25 million from NASA for minority research opportunities
May 7, 2015 UCI has been awarded $1.25 million from NASA as part of a new $5-million 5-year award to establish a new center at Cal State LA for STEM education. This new center will collaborate with UCI’s Data Science Initiative and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)’s Center for Data Science and Technology to train undergraduate and masters students in areas such as climate change, hydrology, computational physics, and data science with an emphasis on minority and low-income students.
Professor Padhraic Smyth, UCI Data Science Initiative Director, will be UCI’s PI on the project and will be working with five other UCI faculty members from engineering, physical science and computer science to host Cal State LA students for short summer workshops and lab visits. The funding will support a project coordinator and provide some summer support for participating faculty and Ph.D. students.
