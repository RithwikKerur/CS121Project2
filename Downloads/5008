Workshop 


WICS hosts a “Toy Hacking” Workshop with Dr. Garnet Hertz 

 02/19/201309/06/2013admin









































We taught children between the 2nd and 5th grades how to circuit bend at the Verano After School Program.  Kids got a first hand experience playing with circuit boards and they expanded their perception of how they have the power to create new things with their older toys, just by breaking them open and learning how to manipulate the electronics inside.
