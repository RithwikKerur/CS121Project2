STAIRS Lab

		Software Engineering & Testing Using Artificial Intelligence for Reliable Software
	







Located at UC Irvine, the mission of  Software Engineering & Testing Using Artificial Intelligence for Reliable Software (STAIRS) lab is helping developers to create maintainable software efficiently. With the main focus on software engineering, we are trying to create better techniques and tools for developing reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. Currently, our research also focuses on how to implement artificial intelligence techniques to analyze software evolution and how software engineering can improve the quality of artificial intelligence software systems. 


We are looking for highly motivated PhD or Master students. Please send resumes and cover letters to iftekha@uci.edu
