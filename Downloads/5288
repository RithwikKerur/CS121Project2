Winter 2022 Week 10: WICS Study Session 

 03/09/202203/09/2022admin



On Monday, March 7th, 2022, WICS held their last general meeting of the Winter Quarter. WICS members and students in the ICS community came together for a study session to get some work done before finals while also meeting other students taking the same or similar classes! In addition, to acknowledge the seniors graduating this quarter, our Alumni Liaison put together a video to commemorate their time with WICS that all the attendees were able to enjoy together.
