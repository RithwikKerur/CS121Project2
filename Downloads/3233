    				Going Home    			


I am now ready to go home.  I will be released in next one hour to go home.  They have given all instructions — starting from injecting my self with blood thinner.  I am now ready to walk around and take care of myself.  
Having grown in India, I keep thinking about the difference on the facilities back there and here.  It will definitely take take a long time for countries like India to provide such facilities to common people.
I am amazed how smoothly everything went.  Dr Warden is a very sweet and competent doctor.  It was nice to work with him.

Since you are on a blood thinner, if you cut yourself or injure yourself-bleeding can be dangerous. I wanted to let you know that there is a new product on the market called KytoStat that is great for external wounds. KytoStat is as easy to use as a regular bandaid. Just apply it to the wound and it stops the bleeding. You donâ€™t even need to wipe the blood away. In fact, the blood allows the chitosan in KytoStat to seal the wound. For more information, visit http://www.kytostat.com

Yes, in the west injecting blood thinner is not a big thing.
