Isley Gao


Informatics and Computer Science
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your studies?
I chose UC Irvine because it is one of the best research-based universities in the nation, and I wanted to be in an atmosphere where my professors are knowledgeable in their teaching material, encouraging students to get involved in research. Additionally, I like that our campus is on the younger end of American universities. Our university has the best of both worlds. We have an amazing faculty of outstanding researchers and while retaining the innovative and flexible feel of a newer campus.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
The most enjoyable part of my studies has most definitely been meeting the professors. Sometimes I feel like a common plebian speaking to an academic noble. After taking their classes and actually getting to know them, I’ve come to realize that they are just as human as I am (except with a lot more accomplishments), and that with time, effort, and the right means, I too can make great accomplishments happen.
Have you done an internship?
No, I have not done any internships related to computing. I entered UCI as a chemistry major, and changed majors after my first quarter. I spent my summer taking classes to be officially under the Donald Bren School of ICS and working for the next school year’s tuition. I am currently applying to internships, as well as looking for research opportunities for the summer and beyond.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
Yes! I believe that in the information technology field, it is not only important to master technical skills, but also to be able to write well and communicate effectively with a team. I serve as the Graduates Section Editor at UCI Anthology Yearbook. I work with a team of other Section Editors to give interviews, record experiences, and design spreads. I manage a small team of interns that I mentor in speaking and writing skills in the context of capturing the profiles of graduating students. I am also a member of Women in Information and Computer Science (WICS), an organization on campus that dedicated to helping women succeed in the information technology field. I am also part of the Systers community, and international forum of women in computing.
What are you most proud of so far?
I’m most proud of how supportive and encouraging the community here is at UCI. I’ve had friends at some universities where their projects were sabotaged by their peers because the competition was so intense. I like that the environment here is challenging but also fosters strong bonds between peers with each other, as well as with professors.
What has been the best part of your experience?
The best part of my experience so far has been working on the Gender Transition in Social Media project under graduate student Oliver Haimson, in the Social and Technological Action Research Group headed by Gillian Hayes. I have learned things that I would not have learned in classes, and I am looking forward to learning more and contributing as much as I can to the project.
What are your aspirations for the future?
I aspire to work in software development, which begs the question, “Why am I not majoring in Software Engineering”? To be fair, the Software Engineering curriculum, a mix of both Informatics and Computer Science courses, seems to be a good foundation for our students pursuing that career path. However, I feel that the Informatics program and the Computer Science program together provide a more comprehensive education for both the upper and mid-levels of the computer science. I have plans to pursue graduate school, and am working hard to be a well-rounded applicant when that time comes.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
My advice to incoming students is to be ambitious, both in what you want to be and what you want to learn. This is something that has helped motivate me to keep moving forward. In this field, our worth is not measured in terms of a list of topics to have memorized (sorry, BioSci majors), but rather in what we can create with the fundamentals that we learn in our classes and in our own time. Thus, it is incredibly important to never stop looking for new things to learn as well as designing and implementing novel ideas.
