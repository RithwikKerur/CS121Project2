Short Bio:
I joined UCI as an assistant
professor in the School of
Information and Computer Sciences in July 2003.  In June 2001
I graduated from the MIT
Computer Science PhD program, where I studied cryptography under the
guidance of Prof. Shafi Goldwasser. 
Between MIT and UCI, I first worked at Intertrust's "StarLab", a small
research lab in the Silicon Valley company which was developing Digital Rights
Management systems, and then I spent a year as a postdoc at the applied cryptography group led by prof. Dan Boneh  at Stanford.
