About me


							I have a PhD in Informatics from the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, 
							where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Yunan Chen and Dr. Kai Zheng in the 
							Health and Informatics lab. 
							My research interests lie at the intersections of Human Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Health. 
							My research focuses on how data tracking technologies can support, change, and impact individuals‚Äô health information needs and 
							health behaviors, particularly in domains which are often stigmatized and among people who are often ignored or marginalized by 
							the medical system and technology industry. 
							

							With the popularity of self-tracking technologies and the datafication of healthcare, healthcare consumers, including patients, 
							caregivers, and healthy individuals, now have access to extensive personal data to inform their health decisions. 
							Because such decisions can be serious and life changing, I investigate how the increased use of patient-generated health data (PGHD) 
							influences individuals‚Äô health behaviors, relationships, and the broader organizational, technological, policy, and societal factors 
							that shape their data work and personal health information management activities.
