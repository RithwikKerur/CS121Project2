Fall 2021 Week 1: WICS First General Meeting 

 10/11/202110/11/2021admin



On Monday, September 27, 2021, of Week 1, WICS held the First General Meeting for the fall quarter of the new year! Existing members and new students from several majors/backgrounds came to learn more about WICS and what events WICS had in store this quarter. General members were also able to learn more about the current WICS Board and Committee members. After the introduction, a fun pop quiz was held, as an opportunity for general members to win exclusive WICS swag! Closing off the night, members headed to UTC for a bonding event, and general members and committee/board members were able to get to know each other over food!
