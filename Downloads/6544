Course Outline








Course Outline
 
This course is a concept class with a lab
          component. The goal of the course is to introduce some of the
          main networking concepts that are taught in any introductory
          networking course and to reinforce those concepts with
          software labs. The labs are structured around exercises that
          highlight topics addressed in the course material taught in
          the weekly classes such as network addressing, subnetting,
          switching, ARP, dynamic routing, and protocols. The course
          consists of 10 weeks of classes. In class quizzes (both
          written and lab) are used to evaluate the students’
          understanding of the material and ensure that students have
          completed the lab exercises. The Piazza online 
          discussion tool will be used to instigate class discussion
          around the course and lap topics. I highly encourage
          participation and give grade credit for those that are active.
