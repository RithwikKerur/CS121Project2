WICS hosts a Toy Hacking Workshop 

 01/28/201309/06/2013admin









































On Monday, January 14th, WICS hosted a Toy Hacking Workshop Training with Dr. Garnet Hertz. Over 20 people attended with bags full of toys to break open!
This workshop was intended to train students who were interested in being involved in a similar workshop for kids in elementary and middle schools! It was an entertaining introduction to electronics, as the attendees ripped apart electronic toys and hacked around with the toys’ music devices.
Highlights of this event were: playing around with resistors to activate a sound, seeing Big Mouth Billy Base singing in different pitches and speeds,  cringing over the disturbing sight of the stripped down Dancing Hamster (“Everybody Dance Now!”).
Our members thought this event was really fun, and many of them expressed their wishes to learn more about toy hacking. As mentioned above, we plan to help host a workshop series with students in elementary and middle schools in the near future.
