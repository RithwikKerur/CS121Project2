WICS Spring Quarter Week 1: First General Meeting 

 04/12/201904/15/2019admin



On April 1st, WICS held their quarterly first general meeting where we present a rundown of what events weâ€™re planning for this quarter. Members grabbed some food and socialized before the presentation. Co-president Cris Agerton led the meeting, informing attendees of what WICS has in store for Spring Quarter as well as throwing in a couple of April Foolsâ€™ jokes. At the end, there was a raffle to win some swag! We hope to see you join us for our this quarterâ€™s events! ðŸ™‚
