ICS 45J Fall 2012 - A Note on Course Grade Computation





A Note on Course Grade Computation



About ICS 45J Course Grades
for Fall 2012
Yep, challenging final--and the midterm was no picnic either:) To account for this, I have lowered the score necessary to achieve an A from 83 to 72, and the other cut-points accordingly, consistent with the grading scheme described in the Course Reference.
The scores in the spreadsheet are in order of the last four digits of student ID number.
Listed are the scores for each lab exam, followed by the total lab points earned, calculated as described in the Lab Manual and Course Reference. Then comes the midterm score, the final exam score, and the score for the pair programming evaluation.

Then appears the course point total, with each of its components weighted as described in the Course Reference, and then your final course grade, the one reported to the Registrar.  (If the grade is to be recorded as P or NP, the Registrar does that conversion.)
The spreadsheet also contains some statistics about the course grade distribution that might interest you.
Do check over your scores; if you find clerical errors  that would change your final grade in the course, contact me about the problem via e-mail. (University policy allows changing grades only because of clerical or procedural error.)
My best wishes for an enjoyable break!
Norm
