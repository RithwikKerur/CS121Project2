    				The Power of Pull    			


The Power of Pull by J. Hagel III, JS Brown, and L Davison is a thought provoking book.  A good read.  It shows that the Edge has become more central to knowledge than the Core.  Core is important but real action is at edges.  Technology has changed the pace at which Edge becomes core and this really changes how we must deal with the whole Knowledge eco system.  It is important to harvest edges.   Good book to read.
