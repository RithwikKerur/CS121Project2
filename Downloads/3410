    				Visual Time Machine    			


Time machine has fascinated people for long time.  Now there is a Visual Time Machine that combines augmented reality with story telling to create a new experience for people wanted to relive the past.  An interesting article on this is here.
An example:
The Palace of Venaria near Turin, Italy, and Winchester Castle in the United Kingdom have already benefited from the technology, which combines augmented reality (AR) content with location awareness on mobile devices to give visitors to historic and cultural sites a deeper, richer and more enjoyable experience. Other places of interest are also set for a virtual renaissance in the near future with a commercial version of the system being developed to run on smart phones.
