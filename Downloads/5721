	Counting the vote
	Election night--VNS
	Impact of computers
Computer Health and Safety
	•OSHA rules
	•ABC's of 
	•Cornells' Ten points
	•Odds and ends
OSHA Rules
	•www.osha.gov
	•draft of 10 October 00 and later
	•"The rules are designed to combat injuries 
	caused by workers doing the same task repeatedly, 
	sometimes know as repetitive-stress disorders, and 
	require business owners to take specific steps 
	to  help workers with such injuries and 
	to prevent additional injuries from occurring." 
	WSJ, 8 Nov 00, B2
	•"Businesses with a worker who experiences 
	a single injury covered by the rule 
	would be required to set up a comprehensive program 
	to address the problem in that job."WSJ, 8 Nov 00, B2
Program

	•assign someone to oversee the program
	•training workers and supervisors to recognize
		and deal with ergonomics-related injuries
	•figuring out how to eliminate or 
		sharply reduce hazards
	•provide injured workers with medical care and
		time off at reduced pay
Example of hazardous task
	"...using a computer	keyboard and/or 
	a computer mouse "in a steady manner 
	for more than four hours total in a workday..."

The ABC’s & DE’s of Computer Health and Safety
	•Awareness
	•Breaks
	•Carriage/Posture
	•(Deadly)Radiation
	•Eyes
	•Furniture
 
Awareness
	•Computers can be dangerous to your health
		Eyes, wrists, arms, back, neck
		Why?  What causes problems?
			(Pascarelli & Quilter, RSI)
			Repetition
			Ignorance
			Strained & Constrained  Posture
			Holding still
			A deconditioned workforce
			Forced speed
			Incentive programs & overtime
			Excessive monitoring
		Not quite a complete list		
	•Most important thing to remember
 
Breaks
	•Best protection against dangers
	•Moderate activity--15 minutes/2 hours
	•Intensive activity-- 15 minutes/1 hour
	•Get up, Non-computer work, Relax
	•Exercises
	•Ergonomic software
 
Carriage/Posture
	•Wrists--straight in both dimensions
	•Wrist rests, braces
	•Forearms--parallel to floor
	•Thighs--parallel to floor
	•Feet--flat on floor, footrest
	•Back--straight
	•Adjust furniture, Exercises
	•CTD--cumulative trauma disorders
	•RSI--repetitive stress injuries
	•Computer athlete
Seven P's (Pascarelli & Quilter, RSI)
	•Physician
	•Pain Management
	•Posture
	•Preventive exercises
	•Positioning
	•Pacing
	•Patience
 
 
(Deadly) Radiation
	•Health effects of monitor radiation--debatable
	•Probably not deadly, but some evidence of problems
	•Monitor should meet MPRII guidelines
	•2.5 feet from front of monitor
	•4.0 feet from side and back of monitor
	•Powerdown when not using monitor
	•Pregnant women should take special precautions
 
 
Eyes
	•Eye examination by an eye care professional
	•Refocus for 5-10 seconds every 10 minutes
	•Copy stand
	•Glasses
	•Lighting, Glare
	•Visual Ergonomics--Ankrum

Furniture
	•Chair, adjustable
	•Table, desk--height
	•Foot rest
	•Copy holder, copy stand
	•Foot rest
	•Wrist rest

What about UCI?
	Some concern for faculty and staff
	Students?  not big users
	Furniture advice, presentations, literature
	Look around
	Not really concerned
UCSD
	Money to help purchase ergonomically
	correct furniture
	Ergo council
