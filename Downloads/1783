Notice: I defended my thesis in summer 2013 and now work at Apple in Seattle.
About

I am a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Irvine. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Alex Ihler and Padhraic Smyth, and as such I enjoy "dual citizenship" in the Statistical Learning and Inference and DataLab groups at UCI. I plan to defend in the summer of 2013.


My research is in the area of approximate inference for probabilistic graphical models. On the theoretical side, I am interested combining sampling-based approximations with variational message-passing algorithms. On the applied side, I am interested in using graphical models to manage association uncertainty in multi-target tracking. Check out my research page for short blurbs about my major projects, along with publications and code.
