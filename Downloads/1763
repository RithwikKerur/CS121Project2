Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Toolbox for Matlab

A reasonably efficient implementation of spatial data structures for kernel or Parzen window
density estimation and similar functions.  Most work is done by a k-d tree data structure; versions
of the "fast Gauss transform" and nearest neighbor searches are also included.  Written as a Matlab
class, with methods for many standard distributional operations (estimating entropy, evaluating, etc.)
