Your Success Starts at ICS



Join more than 800 graduate students studying virtually every area within the fields of Computer Science, Informatics, Networked Systems, Software Engineering and Statistics, as well as many new interdisciplinary topics. With more than 100 faculty members spanning three departments—Computer Science, Informatics and Statistics—this is a very exciting time to be a part of the Donald Bren School.
Almost all of our Ph.D. students receive financial aid in the form of teaching assistantships or research assistantships during their time at UC Irvine. Many of them also receive fellowships from the Bren School's corporate partners and private supporters.
You can still apply to ICS if your undergraduate degree is not in the same area as the graduate degree in which you are interested. However, it is helpful if you have taken courses in computer science and math, and/or have some related work experience.
A complete list of our graduate programs is below so you can explore which one is right for you. You can also visit the UCI Course Catalogue for more in-depth information about each ICS graduate program.
