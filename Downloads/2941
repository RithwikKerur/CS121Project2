    				SEraja Updates 061105    			


Seraja has its Beta site up and running.Â  It has much better interfaces and has good features for many things including groups.Â  The site will be changing quite a lot over the next few months by bringing in Eventoscope, relationships among events, and many other features.Â  I am personally going to use it a lot as a companion piece to my blog.Â  Infact Seraja offers an interesting environment by being a blog and a wiki for events.Â 
The site is available at
beta.seraja.com
