    				Honorary Professorship    			


When I arrived to give my talk at Technical University of Varna at 2 PM today, I was presented with a great surprise.  They requested me to meet the Rector (Vice Chancellor) of the University.  There I was told that I was going to be awarded â€˜Honorary Professorshipâ€? in a special ceremony.  This was a big surprise to me â€“ I had no idea that they had such a plan.  I definitely felt flattered.  I was explained the whole ceremony â€“ particularly because much of it was going to be in Bulgarian.  I had to wear a gown required for the ceremony.  I was given a certificate and a plaque â€“ depicting the gowning â€“ at the ceremony.
My talk went well.  There was a good audience.  I talked about the importance of visual information retrieval in the current technology space.  Presented a brief review of image and video retrieval and mentioned what I consider important problems in this space.  There were good set of questions after the presentation.
I am still trying to get over the recognition and award that I was given â€“ and I find it interesting that I was not even given a hint of this.
