Winter 2022 Week 4: Postman API Workshop 

 02/07/202202/07/2022admin



On Monday, January 24, 2022, WICS invited Claire Froelich, a company representative from Postman, to give a workshop about APIs! After an explanation of the basics of APIs, servers/clients, and Postman, members had the opportunity to work hands-on with APIs on Postman by accessing, adding, and editing books in the Postman library API. Together, they even accessed data from the Github API! Through this experience, members were able to gain real-world experience working with APIs in Postman, an important skill for their future careers in programming.
