WICS Spring Quarter Week 7: Women in Tech Panel with SendGrid 

 05/14/201809/18/2018admin



On Monday, May 14th, WICS and SendGrid held a Women in Tech panel at the new SendGrid office, 400 Spectrum Dr. Approximately 30 students drove to the office and attended this event. From 5:30pm to 6:00pm, students had dinner provided by SendGrid in the office. The panel started at 6:00pm, where 5 female representatives from SendGrid were invited to the panel. At the beginning they each talked about their career path, how they ended up working at SendGrid and why they decided to stay at this job. Then they talked about how the number of women in technology has changed over years. One representative shared her experience of being the only the female in the team when she first started working 10-20 years ago, and other representatives agreed with her and said they also had the same kind of experience. Over the years, more and more females have joined this field. Now they have many more female co-workers. At the end, they were open to questions, one male student asked what men can do to help women in this field. After the panel, a lot of students stayed to have conversations with the representatives. The event ended at 8 pm. Overall, it was a successful and eye-opening event!
