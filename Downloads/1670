Course Overview

This two-course sequence is intended to be the "grand finale" for Data Science majors.
Its goal is to tie together many of the topics that are independently covered in the first 3+ years of Data Science requirements and electives; it also aims to fill in in some of the potential gaps required to solve an end-to-end problem. 
In addition to a brief review of some of the required skills, the course will cover problem definition and analysis, data representation, algorithm selection, solution validation, and results presentation.
Students will do projects, possibly in small teams, while the lecture periods will cover analysis alternatives, project planning, and data analysis issues.
The first quarter will emphasize tools and techniques, approach selection, project planning, and experimental design.
The second quarter will focus on project execution, data analysis, and presentation of results.
Project planning and execution will include the setting of weekly or bi-weekly milestones as well as weekly progress tracking and reporting.
The final course deliverables will include both a written project report and an oral presentation of the project results.

Prerequisites

Senior standing and completion of the following courses: STATS 68, STATS 111, IN4MATX 43, COMPSCI 122A, COMPSCI 161, and COMPSCI 178.

Assignments, Projects, and Grading
Winter Grading Criteria (for 170A)

Homework: 40% 
Project proposal: 50% 
Class participation: 10% 

Late homeworks will not be graded - please submit whatever you have completed by the homework deadline.  Each homework's due date is listed in the table of homework assignments at the end of this page, and each homework will be due in EEE by 11:45 PM on the indicated date.

Spring Grading Criteria (for 170B)

Attendance: 10% 
Weekly status updates: 18% 
In-class presentations: 40% 
Final written report: 32% 


A single grade will be assigned at the end of Spring quarter for this class, with 50% weight on the Winter grade and 50% on the Spring grade.

Winter Homework and Class Participation

The first quarter will involve a mix of lectures and homework assignments intended to dust off, sharpen, or introduce the skills, tools, and techniques that you will need to successfully execute your course project. Since you are now seniors, and this is your Data Science grand finale, individual initiative and engagement will be expected of all students. The homework assignments may be "looser" than what you are used to -- you will have to seek out some of the information needed to complete the assignments and to make  choices about how to attack some of the challenges -- i.e., spoon feeding will be kept to a minimum. The lectures will aim for interactivity, and class participation will be encouraged (and in fact expected).

Spring Project Tracking and Reporting

The second quarter will be a time to focus on your projects. In terms of grading, 10% will be given for attending the Invited DS Case Study talks every other week (5%) and making at least a brief appearance at office hours during the off weeks (5%). 18% of your grade will be based on weekly progress reporting via your "project diary" in Google docs; you will get 2 points/week (first 9 weeks) for your last week/this week progress bullets. 40% will be for the 5 in-class presentations that you'll do (4 oral progress reports/demos plus 1 final oral presentation). Last but not least, of course, is your final written report, which will account for 32% of your Spring grade.

Academic Honesty Policy

Students will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see ​http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and ​http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say no to cheating!


Software Platform(s)

This course will make use of the Python ecosystem, including the Python language, various Python packages/tools for data analysis and machine learning, Jupyter notebooks, and open source databases (PostgreSQL).  For convenience and package completeness, students are advised to download the most recent Anaconda distribution of Python and friends (​https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the most recent EDB distribution of PostgreSQL (​https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
