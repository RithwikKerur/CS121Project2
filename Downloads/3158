    				Nagpur person to head Citi Bank    			


It is now final that Mr Vikram Pandit will head Citi Bank.  Mr Pandit is from Nagpur.  It is nice to see that a Nagpur person is going to lead one of the most respected financial institution in the world.
As a Nagpurian I am proud of this.
And I am looking forward to my yearly trip to Nagpur later this month.
