    				Bangalore Hotels    			


This time I am staying at The Chevron Hotel.  Located on Infantry road, this hotel’s location is good.  It is a clean and neat hotel — does not have the ambience of Taj or Windsor or Leela, but has good rooms and the rates are less than 30% of those places.
I also liked the fact that they have NO charge for Wi Fi.  Having paid about 24 Euros per day recently in Athens for Internet, this is amazing.
