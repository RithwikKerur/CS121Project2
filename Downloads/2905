    				Back home    			


It feels real good to be back home after spending three weeks in hotel rooms and eating all restaurant meals.Â  Now the quarter and lots of interesting things are waiting here.Â  This quarter is not going to be easy in terms of travel.Â  Three international trips (including the one in December) are not something that I find attractive at this moment — but have to do.
IÂ can not complain, however, for things thatÂ I schedule.Â

I have just returned home from Egypt, we went here with my family  for a vacation. everything was fine, but we were so glad to escape the heat and board the plane on the dya of our departure, you can imagine..  Earlier in my life i had to travle 8 months of a year and it was  really a nightmare, as I though that Iam everyone’s man  and  at the same time bleonged to noone and had no own place
