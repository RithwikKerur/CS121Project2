Faculty profile




Magda  El ZarkiProfessorDEGREE:Ph.D. 1988, Columbia UniversityRESEARCH AREAS: Multimedia ComputingNetworks and Distributed SystemsRESEARCH INTERESTS: Prof. El Zarki's research focus was primarily on multimedia transmission over the Internet. The work consists of both theoretical studies and practical implementations of new mechanisms that improve overall quality of service. Recent research efforts shifted to networked games and massively multi user virtual environments (MMUVE). The emphasis of the work is on the player's quality of experience in games where precision and time constraints are a major concern for game playability. Another effort in this area focuses on the development of "Serious Games" for education, digital heritage and health.
