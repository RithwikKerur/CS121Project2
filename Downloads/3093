    				Videoconferencing in future — for seniors    			


News.com has a story on Videoconferencing for seniors.Â  This article features my good friend Ruzena Bajcsy.
“Currently, videoconferencing is very limited. It just shows your face or a small image, and is not very robust,” said Bajcsy, an electrical-engineering and computer science professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
The TEEVE project is just one of a number of technologies being developed that will add to a growing selection of videoconferencing packages for the elderly.
The more interesting part is that many of these systems being built use too many cameras and computers making them impractical not only today but in near future.Â  I believe that this is due to wrong approach adopted in video conferencing.Â  It will be intereting to think not about video conferencing or abur telepresence as they sound but to consider this as a new technology that is more environment-to-environment (e2e) connectivity as the next stage in person-to-person and device-to-device connectivities.Â  More on that sometime soon.
