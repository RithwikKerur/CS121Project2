ChangesFromPmWiki1






This page is intended to describe features of PmWiki 1.0 that have been changed or eliminated in PmWiki 2.0.  For now this page will be maintained as a simple list and will probably need some restructuring later.

Markup changes
Double brackets are used for all links, including [[free links]].  Providing alternate text for a link is performed using either a vertical brace  [[PageName | link text]] or an arrow [[link text -> PageName]].  See PmWiki.Links.
So far, the ThisPage:, ThisGroup:, etc., InterMap shortcuts are not defined.  In fact, they may not be needed in PmWiki 2.  If someone needs them, add an entry to PITS:NewIssue explaining why.Ok, so as an example, how next lines, which are in a sidebar, may be written in pmwiki2 ?*[[ThisPage:?action=upload Upload]]*[[ThisGroup:SideBar&action=edit Edit menu]]
 You can write them as [[{$Name}?action=upload | Upload]] and [[{$Group}/SideBar?action=edit | Edit menu]].  
(The variables {$Name} and {$Group} are page variables.)
Changes affecting skins
$PageTemplateFmt is obsolete, but $PageTemplateFmt still works, and this may change yet again before the 2.0 official release. To use a different skin, you can use the $Skin variable ($Skin = 'skinname';) and just fill it with the name of the skin, it will assume it's in the pub/skins/[skinname] folder containing the [skinname].tmpl file.
$HTMLTitleFmt no longer exists -- just place the <title> information directly into the template.
In $...Fmt strings, $Title_ and $Title are currently represented by $Name.  $Title is now used to refer to a page's title (which may be different from its name and could have different formatting, such as spaces).
The css/stdlayout.css file no longer exists; PmWiki and other modules now place required formatting styles directly into the $HTMLStylesFmt array.
$PageName is now $FullName.  $PageName still functions but will be removed in the 2.0 official release.
Searching now uses the q= variable to provide the text to be searched (formerly the search text went in the text= variable.
Other Customization Changes
PmWiki 2 now uses session-based authentication by default.  If you want to continue to use HTTP-Basic authentication, add the following line to config.php:
        include_once('scripts/httpauth.php');
Disabling WikiWords is now done by setting $LinkWikiWords .  Previously this was controlled by $WikiWordCountMax .
$HTMLLineBreak is now $HTMLPNewline.  See Cookbook:Line Breaks.
The skins system has been revised, and is now much more flexibly controlled by the $Skin and $ActionSkins variables.  See PmWiki.Skins.  But $PageTemplateFmt still works.
The $BrowseReplacements, $DoubleBrackets, and $InlineReplacements arrays are no longer used -- see custom markup.
?action=post no longer exists -- posting a new page is now performed by using ?action=edit with the post control set to a true value.
$WikiWordPagePathFmt is now $PagePathFmt, which is applied to all page links not qualified by a group.
$WikiPageExistsFmt, $WikiPageCreateFmt, etc. are now $LinkPageExistsFmt, $LinkPageCreateFmt, etc.
$DeleteKeyWord is now $DeleteKeyPattern.
$GroupHeaderFmt and $GroupFooterFmt now specify the markup to be added to the beginning and end of each page, rather than the name of the page.  The default settings of $GroupHeaderFmt and $GroupFooterFmt perform the equivalent of an (:include:) of the GroupHeader and GroupFooter pages.
PmWiki's ReadPage() function no longer supplies default text for non-existent pages -- this is now decided by whatever functions need the page.  (As of 2.0.devel9 the default text is still stored in $DefaultPageTextFmt, however.)
$SearchExcludePatterns is now simply $SearchPatterns and can be chosen by the list= parameter to (:searchresults:) and (:pagelist:).  See Cookbook:SearchResults.
$EnablePerGroupCust is now $EnablePGCust.
$TableCellAttr is now $TableCellAttrFmt.
$Url is now $LinkUrl.
