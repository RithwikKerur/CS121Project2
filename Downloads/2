Handcuffing Big Brother: An Abuse-Resilient Transaction Escrow Scheme


	Stanislaw Jarecki and Vitaly Shmatikov
ABSTRACT:

We propose a practical abuse-resilient transaction escrow scheme with 
	applications to privacy-preserving audit and monitoring of electronic 
	transactions. Our scheme ensures correctness of escrows as long as at least one 
	of the participating parties is honest, and it ensures privacy and anonymity of 
	transactions even if the escrow agent is corrupt or malicious. The escrowed 
	information is secret and anonymous, but the escrow agent can efficiently find 
	transactions involving some user in response to a subpoena or a search warrant. 
	Moreover, for applications such as abuse-resilient monitoring of unusually high 
	levels of certain transactions, the escrow agent can identify escrows with 
	particular common characteristics and automatically (i.e., without a subpoena) 
	open them once their number has reached a pre-specified threshold. Our solution 
	for transaction escrow is based on the use of Verifiable Random Functions. We 
	show that by tagging the entries in the escrow database using VRFs 
	indexed by users' private keys, we can protect users' anonymity while enabling 
	efficient and, optionally, automatic de-escrow of these entries. We give a 
	practical instantiation of a transaction escrow scheme utilizing a simple and 
	efficient VRF family secure under the DDH assumption in the Random Oracle 
	Model.
