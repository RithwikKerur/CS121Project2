    				Picture search at ASK    			


Ask Jeeves has announced new picture search — pictures.ask.com — that is claimed to be better than the earlier search.
My few minutes with it suggested that it is very similar to what other image searches are from Google and Yahoo.  It seems to rely completely on the name of the file and the text on the page — it still does not look in the image file.
