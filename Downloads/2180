We are hiring! Multiple positions are available! 











 

















We are actively looking for talented and dedicated students and postdocs to work on multidisciplinary projects in bioinformatics. We welcome all candidates with backgrounds in computer science, mathematics, engineering, and medicine to tackle interesting and challenging biomedical questions. We also welcome intern students with deep learning [and/or] genomics background for research training, both remotely and on-site. If you are interested in joining our lab, please send an email to zhang [dot] jing [at] uci.edu, with the exact subject line “[Postdoc/Research assistant/intern] position application from YourName”.  

















Ph.D. students:We are keen to recruit graduate students for research training and completing a Ph.D. thesis in the lab. Prospective students interested in developing computational methods in various biomedical applications should apply via the Ph.D. program of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at UCI. We are also interested in enrolling students through other programs, such as UCI Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology (MCSB).Admitted Ph.D. students interested in joining our lab are also encouraged to contact Dr. Zhang for rotation opportunities.Specialists:Specialists – We may have multiple positions for specialists with substantial research experience in deep learning methods and/or database maintenance. Candidates with solid programming skills are highly preferred.Undergraduates:Undergraduates – Undergraduates interested in volunteering or working for credit should send their transcripts, a CV, and a description of research interests and education goals.Postdoctoral Scholars:Postdoctoral researcher positions are available in the laboratory of Jing Zhang at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences of UCI. The long-term research goal of Dr. Zhang’s Lab is to develop advanced machine learning methods on large-scale functional genomics data. The ideal applicant would already have some experience in single-cell sequencing data analysis. However, candidates with strong quantitative training (e.g., Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, or related) would also be encouraged. A successful candidate must have strong programming skills (e.g., experience with C/C++, R/Matlab, python, and so on). Good oral and written communication skills are also required. A publication record of at least two first-author (including co-first author) papers/preprints are required at the time of application. If you are interested, please send your CV, brief introduction, and a two-paragraph research plan via email.
