Jason Heckard


Computer Game Science
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your studies?
My wife and I were in Elko, Nev., where I was employed as a mechanic at a cryogenics plant. I contacted a number of game studios to inquire about necessary skills for breaking into the industry, and their responses were overwhelmingly negative, with one saying “do not ever contact us with this question again.” But the HR representative from Blizzard Entertainment recommended that I contact the local chapter of the International Game Developer’s Association (IGDA). So, we moved to San Diego and I enrolled at San Diego Mesa College. There, I joined the IGDA San Diego chapter. IGDA hosted an event in March 2011 called Pre-GDC, where I met a Blizzard Games representative. I asked him, “How do I get a job at Blizzard?” His answer: “Go to UC Irvine.” I saw that UC Irvine had a computer game science program along with a computer science program. Knowing nothing about what the computer game science major entailed, I applied and was accepted.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
The best part has definitely been the study and development of games. I had never studied game theory, so it’s been interesting to learn about game interaction and theory of play. The development of interactive software has also been an exciting facet of my studies, because I am gaining skills toward developing more complex projects.
Have you done an internship? If so, what project, and in what role?
I interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena Summer 2014. I was brought on to design a graphical useri (GUI) for the radar system used by in the Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMoss) mission. I developed a proof of concept that showed that the existing GUI, built with Motif software, could be replaced by a browser-based GUI. My project was built in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and uses the open-source libraries jQuery and CanvasJS.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies? If so, which ones?
I am a leader in the Veterans Professional Fraternity. It is a young organization, founded in 2011, that is trying to build a support network of veteran students at UC Irvine across different majors and schools. We focus on community service and outreach to other veteran students at UCI and surrounding junior colleges. My roles right now involve assisting with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department Gang Deterrence Team (GDT) event during Celebrate UCI 2015, and assisting with outreach to community college students who may be interested in applying to UC Irvine.
What are you most proud of so far?
I am proud of the fact that I am succeeding academically. Some classes have been a struggle. I was first introduced to programming at age 31, was immediately thrown into some very difficult undergraduate computing courses at UCI. Now that I am finished with those required courses, I am happy to focus on the classes that I find most interesting and engaging.
What has been the best part of your experience so far?
Building games and virtual environments, even if they are relatively simple. One lower-division project entailed developing an interactive environment with a moving character, solid platforms and gravity. Another lower-division project involved building an interactive game that required keyboard-mouse inputs and use of a physics engine. I was getting to watch the magic of video game software come alive for the first time, and it was exciting! One computer game science elective taught me how to build virtual environments around real-world images using an Android device camera. My team turned the face of a dollar bill into a 3D tic-tac-toe game. The development was painstaking, but the end result was amazing!
What are your aspirations for the future?
I hope to be a level designer or game designer for a studio. My dream job is to develop levels and enemies for games comparable to South Park: the Stick of Truth or Borderlands. I have attended a number of job fairs and talked to recruiters from non-game software development firms. Now that I have a strong background in source code software development, I have become much more interested in non-game software development as well.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
Be open to opportunities. The skills developed in the computer game science major are farther-reaching than a game studio. Focus on what you like, but be open to using those skills in areas of software development besides games. There are significantly more students looking for opportunities at places like Blizzard and Riot Games than there are openings, so consider how to apply technical skills to places other than game development. Also, pay attention to graduation requirements. The computer game science program should be followed in a strictly defined order of courses. Most of the required courses are only offered once a year, so contacting the professor and ICS counselors to get enrolled in a required class may be necessary. Ultimately, however, the persistence will pay off in completing a fantastic program!
