Theatrical Play & Narrative Interfaces 















Drawing on practices from theater and the performing arts we are creating games that use costumes to help elicit a sense of character identification and identity transformation from players, and studying the impact that wearing costumes and masks has on socially co-located play and solo play. We look at how the body of the player can be treated as a form of “narrativized interface” through the design of embodied interactions.Associated ProjectsShadowCastMagia Transformo – The Dance of TransformationCostumes as Game Controllers Studio at TEICostumes as Game Controllers Workshop at UCICostumed Gaming StudyTheatrical Play BookAssociated Publications2008 ICIDS Paper: Improvisation and Performance as Models for Interacting with Stories2009 SIGGRAPH Paper: Rock Band: A Case Study in the Design of Embodied Interface Experience2011 International Journal of Art + Technology Article: Games Narrative and the Design of Interface2011 ICIDS Paper: Being in the Story: Readerly Pleasure, Acting Theory, and Performing a Role2013 C&C Paper: The Effects of Physicality on the Child’s Imagination2013 ICIDS Paper: Performative Authoring:  Nurturing Storytelling in Children through Imaginative Enactment2015 PhD Dissertation: Identity Transformation and Agency in Digital Narratives and Story Based Games2015 TEI Studio: Costumes and Wearables as Game Controllers2015 FDG Paper: Envisioning the Future of Wearable Play: Conceptual Models for Props and Costumes as Game Controllers2015 FDG Paper: Empathy and Identity in Digital Games: Towards a New Theory of Transformative Play 2015 QGCon Talk: Cosplayed Gaming: Exploring Gender Identity through Costumed Play2016 DiGRA Talk: “ITS’A ME, MARIO!”: COSTUMED GAMING’S EFFECTS ON CHARACTER IDENTIFICATION2017 Analog Game Studies Article: Chalk, Props, and Costumes: Two Exercises for Teaching Pervasive Game Design
