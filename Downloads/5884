Graduate Student Policies: CPT and OPT

Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
International students may be eligible for CPT, a type of employment authorization that allows students to complete an internship/training off campus during the summer. CPT is not available after a student completes a degree program.
Consult the International Center for CPT policies and application requirements. Students will need the approval of their advisor on the CPT application.
 
 
Optional Practical Training (OPT)
International students may be eligible for OPT after graduation. OPT provides the opportunity to gain employment experience in the student’s major/field of study.
Consult the International Center for OPT policies and application requirements. The ICS Graduate Counselors can verify your graduation date and sign the Graduation Confirmation/OPT Recommendation Form that is required as part of the OPT application package.
