RefCount





< Passwords administration | Documentation Index | Url approvals >



RefCount performs link reference counts on pages in the PmWiki database (i.e., counts of links between pages).  Before using RefCount, it must be enabled by the wiki administrator by placing the following line in a local customization file:

include_once("$FarmD/scripts/refcount.php");
To use refcount add ?action=refcount to the URL of any wiki page to bring up the reference count form. For example:

PmWiki.RefCount?action=refcount
The refcount form contains the following controls:

Show ~ This selects which pages will appear in the output
all ~ Shows all references 
missing ~ Shows only references to pages that don't exist
existing ~ Shows only references to pages that do exist
orphaned ~ Shows pages that exist but don't have any references to them.  There is no way to browse to an orphaned page.
page names in group ~ Selects which group(s) to the referenced pages can be in
referenced from pages in ~ Selects which group(s) the referencing pages can be in
Display referencing pages ~ Includes a link to the referencing page -- this can make for a very long output unless you limit the groups searched


The output is a table where each row of the table contains a page name or link reference, the number of (non-RecentChanges) pages that contain links to the page and the number of Recent Changes pages with links to the page.
