Conference Research Themes
Effectively engineering software in a global context is a key competitive advantage in today’s IT and software industry. However, the increased globalization of software development creates challenges due to the impact of time zones, diversity of culture and communication, or distance. This requires novel and effective techniques and practices to achieve intended productivity and quality targets.
The 11th International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE) brings together researchers and practitioners interested in solving the challenges of continentally distributed software engineering. The ICGSE 2016 organizing committee invites academic and industrial communities to contribute to the expertise of the international global software engineering community.


“ICGSE is an exciting event with lots of insight about best practices in different companies as well as innovative research. Excellence in global software engineering is pivotal for competitiveness and success. ICGSE hits the mark each time.”    – Christof Ebert, Vector, Germany

“ICGSE is the conference I attended as an academic and still participate in now that I am in industry. Being part of the discussions in this supportive community has left me with valuable lessons I continue to practice today.”   – Ban Al-Ani, Automatic Data Processing, USA


ICGSE 2016 is being held in Irvine, Orange County, California. Over 600 IT companies are located in Orange County, with IT being OC’s  #1 industry in terms of revenue. Orange County recently ranked second in the nation in the number of high-tech clusters. A sampling of OC’s diverse IT industry includes: e-commerce and data analytics companies such as Amazon, Experian, Google, Houzz  and Zillow; game development studios such as Blizzard Entertainment,  inXile Entertainment, Obsidian Entertainment, and NCSOFT; software and services companies such as IBM, MSC, and Oracle; financial service firms such as PIMCO; software intensive design and manufacturing companies such as Broadcom, Conexant, and Western Digital; and healthcare IT companies such as Optum.
The conference is being hosted at the University of California, Irvine, celebrating it's 50th anniversary this year.

A note about our banner image. California is in the midst of a very serious long-term drought, and water conservation is mandated. There is now a popular movement towards drought tolerant landscaping with native vegetation that is suitable for our naturally semi-arid climate. Our banner image features the native California poppy–the state flower of California–in a drought tolerant rock garden setting. While you are in California, we hope you enjoy not only our gorgeous beaches but all our natural landscape beauty.
