    				The State of Venture Capital    			


For any budding entrepreneur it will be important to know the state of Venture Capital.  A good article is in Fobes.
On the surface it may appear to be a pessimistic scenario.  On careful thinking it does suggest that a budding entrepreneur has to think more creatively.  In place of raising lots of funds and building a company rapidly without worrying about revenue flow, one may want to think creatively about the business models — a bit old fashioned but not uncommon — that will allow revenues flowing in earlier than the Internet Boom made people think.  We may have forgotten this, but until about 1996, that used to be the common approach.  So this is really back to basics.
