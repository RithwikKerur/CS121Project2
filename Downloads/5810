Global Game Jam connects UCI with OC’s game design community




Professor Tanenbaum brought together 130 people who collectively created 20 wave-themed games in 48 hours.

This year’s Global Game Jam (GGJ) was a huge success for UC Irvine and GGJ site organizer Theresa Jean Tanenbaum, assistant professor of informatics at UCI. For 48 hours of game development mayhem from Jan. 20-22, 130 people joined the fun, compared to the roughly 50 participants GGJ had last year. This was the third year Tanenbaum has hosted the event at UC Irvine.

ESPN: “Panelists hoping to crack code of female acceptance in gaming”

February 1, 2017


On Thursday, in the shadows of a freshly constructed gaming center on the campus of University of California Irvine, a panel called “Women in Gaming” will set out to reshape these perceptions. Much like the physical space UCI has recently created to allow the world of esports and video game development to infiltrate the academic landscape, five female panelists will explore ways to increase the visibility and representation of women in competitive gaming.

Medium: “Bad Habits You Need to Kill Immediately to be a Much Better Person This Year” (Mark cited)

January 30, 2017


Stop multi-tasking, seriously stop. Of all the bad habits, multitasking is among the worst and most common. Multi-tasking does not necessarily make you more productive as you may think. You can actually achieve more in less time when you single task and focus on getting one thing done well.
It takes about 23 minutes and 15 seconds to fully return to a task after interruption, according to Gloria Mark, Professor at UC Irvine, in Fast Company. So you may be wasting a lot more time than you think.

Cool Material: “8 Tips to Help You Achieve Inbox Zero” (Mark mentioned)

January 13, 2017


Even if it means allowing emails to pile up momentarily, don’t spend too much time in your inbox. According to Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at University of California, Irvine, a lot of people striving for Inbox Zero typically do so as part of a weird game. She says that when people compulsively and continuously check their emails, they lose out big on productivity—the whole reason for Inbox Zero, to begin with. In fact, it’s so bad, she says, that when people are taken off task, it can take a whole 25 minutes for them to get back on track. So, if you want to be more organized without losing out on productivity, try not to compulsively check your inbox.

End of Term Digital Preservation and How You Can Help

January 7, 2017


Join Informatics for an EOT Archiving Hackathon on Jan. 11 to help save environmental data from deletion.
There is a new old adage that parents tell their children: whatever you post on the Internet, stays on the Internet. Digital permanence has become an inconvenient, sometimes destructive, truth to social media hotheads who post before thinking, but what about information on U.S. Government websites? Is climate change data as equally eternal as a celebrity tweet? The answer is less simple.
That’s why archivists and concerned citizens have begun to take notice that federal government websites (eg., .gov, .mil, etc.) in the legislative, executive and judicial branches were at risk of being changed, consolidated, buried or altogether disappearing from public access during presidential transitions. Since 2008, the End of Term (EOT) Web Archive has preserved websites from both Republican and Democratic administration changes in 2008 and 2012, and is now preparing for the arrival of a Donald Trump presidency.
