    				In Greece    			


I am attending Multimedia Semantics workshop in Chania, Crete.  I came here on Sunday and will be here until Wednesday.  Then will be in Athens for 3 days.
On the way back will be stopping in Washington for 4 days.
Lots of travel.  But it is fun ‚Äî intellectually and then a short vacation.
