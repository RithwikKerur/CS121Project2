    				New media and face-to-face interactions    			


Many people feel that with new media making video and telepresence easy, people will move away from face-to-face meetings.Â  As demonstrated by the meeting of YouTube bloggers (see report from News.com here) that does not seem to be the case:

The good news for those who fear that technology is eroding personal interaction is that many of the attendees said they came specifically for some face-to-face interaction.
“We thought it’d be good to remove some of the barriers of the Internet,” said Damien Estreich, 21, whose handle on YouTube is YourTubeNEWS. “That was the goal, to come here and share ideas and maybe learn each other’s real names.”
