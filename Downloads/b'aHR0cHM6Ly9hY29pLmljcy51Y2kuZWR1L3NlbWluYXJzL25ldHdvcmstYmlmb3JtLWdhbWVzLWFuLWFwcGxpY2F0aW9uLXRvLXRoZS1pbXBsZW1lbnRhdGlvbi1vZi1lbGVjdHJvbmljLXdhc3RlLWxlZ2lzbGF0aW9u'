Abstract: Biform games are a class of hybrid noncooperative-cooperative game developed to analyze collaboration among strategic and competing entities. It combines equilibrium characterization of independent moves from noncooperative games and profit/cost sharing mechanism design from cooperative games. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges and methodologies to analyze biform games. In doing so, I will focus on an application of the biform game framework to study electronic waste (e-waste) recycling legislation. I will describe how the implementation of e-waste regulation can be modeled by a network-optimization-based biform game, and how algorithms can help in solving that game. I will then discuss the relation of the solution of the network biform game to the classical notion of convex games, and its implications on the structural properties of the underlying network. I will finish by discussing the practical insights and policy input that can be generated by the network biform game analysis.
The talk is based on the following paper. https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2897
