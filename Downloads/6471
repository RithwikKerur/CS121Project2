The Master of Computer Science (MCS) is a professionally oriented degree that spans across fifteen months.  The program requires the completion of 52 units and includes three core courses, three keystone/capstone courses, six elective courses and one summer course.  Our courses have a lab/ project component that emphasizes a hands-on learning environment, with strong emphasis on practical applications and implementation.Our program is a full-time program.  We currently do not offer a part-time program option.Program Learning ObjectivesUnderstand and apply foundational Computer Science principles to strengthen the students’ knowledge of the computing landscape.Apply mathematical foundations and algorithmic principles in the modeling, design, and analysis of computer-based systems.Apply design and development principles in the construction of computation-based systems of varying complexity.Gain practical and technical computing skills to develop solutions for real world problems.Demonstrate effective written and oral communication skills within teams and among colleagues.Enhance personal development through topics related to career and professional development.Advising and Career DevelopmentStudents in the program will receive academic advising and career development support throughout the entirety of the program. Our academic counselor will help students with course selection and academic plans to ensure that they are on the right track to successfully fulfill all requirements for graduation.  Alongside academic advising, students in the program will receive comprehensive career and professional development support by our career development team.  Our career development team provides students with career coaching, career competitiveness, and career connections.CapstoneThe two capstone courses (CS 296P Writing and Communication and CS 297P Design Project) are taught concurrently in the Spring.Description of the Capstone Element:The design project will involve taking a new idea from conception to prototype development and validation.Projects will draw on skills learned in several of the courses in the curriculum and will be initiated by computer science faculty or by our corporate affiliates.Students will form teams of two-four students and their work will be supervised by both the instructor of the course and a faculty project mentor who will be involved in all aspects of the project.The scope of the projects will include physical prototype development, appropriate testing and detailed documentation. Ideally projects will represent a complete system or product, integrating analysis, simulation, and software and hardware design as appropriate. The professional writing and communication for computer science careers course will involve the development of design and detailed project description documents for the design project. It will also include assignments related to other aspects of their professional careers.
