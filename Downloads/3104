    				Long (and short) trip — ending    			


On 29th July when Sudha and I came here to Singapore, we were thinking that it is going to be long time until 14th september.Â  Today I am thinking time went too fast.Â  It is amazing how time went by so fast.Â  Now it is time to return back.Â  I have accomplished somethings that I wanted to do but much remains to be settled.Â  This is usual.
Â This trip convinced me that Singapore is one of the most cosmopolitan place in the world and is a nice place to live.Â  Like every place, it has its weaknesses and strengths, but clearly strengths outweigh weaknesses.
During this trip, several interesting technical ideas started taking shape.Â  Hopefully I will be able to capitalize on those and build some concrete things in the near future.
