Tsudik receives ICCCN Best Paper Award
August 2, 2017 Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science Gene Tsudik co-authored a paper, titled “Closing the Floodgate with Stateless Content-Centric Networking,” which received the Best Paper Award at the 26th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN) that took place July 31-Aug. 3, 2017 in Vancouver, Canada. The ICCCN, which is co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, is a leading international conference for presenting new ideas and fundamental advances in the fields of computer networks and communications.

The other authors of the award-winning paper are ICS alumnus Cesar Ghali, a software engineer at Google; ICS alumnus Ersin Uzun, who currently leads the System Sciences Laboratory (SSL) at PARC as VP and director of the facility; and Christopher Wood, a fourth-year computer science Ph.D. student under Tsudik and a secure transports engineer at Apple whose research focuses on applied cryptography and network security. Their paper explores the supposed benefits and various issues of the stateful forwarding plane in Content Centric Networking (CCN) in order to propose a new stateless architecture for CCN that provides nearly all functionality of the former design without its frustrations.
Tsudik is a Fulbright Scholar; an ACM, IEEE and AAAS fellow; a foreign member of Academia Europaea; and managing director of UCI’s Secure Computing and Networking Center. His research areas include privacy, computer and network security, and applied cryptography.
