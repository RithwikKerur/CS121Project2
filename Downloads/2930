    				ACM Multimedia 2006    			


I am in Santa Barbara to attend ACM Multimedia 2006 — a yearly conference at which leading academic research in Multimedia is presented and discussed.Â  Close to 500 researchers from all over the world are here.Â  This is a conference that is like family get-to-gether for me.Â  Chance to meet many friends — and since I am in my fourth year of Chairmanship of ACM Multimedia, I have many meetings also.
Yesterday the reception was at the new Nanotechnology bldg at UCSB Campus.Â  The most interesting thing — from our perspective there is the Immersive Scientific ENvironment — that is what JoAnn calls it — that has been created.Â  Really impressive environment.Â  Have not seen anything like this anywhere.
I am posting photos on flickr under ACMMM06 so you can see those there.
Here is a scene from the immersive environment — viewers enjoying the immersion in brain.
