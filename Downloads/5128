WICS Fall Quarter Week 4: WICS Trivia Night 

 11/06/2020admin



On Monday, October 26th, 2020 of Week 3, we hosted a Trivia Night filled with jeopardy style questions and answers. This was a fun social event where we got to interact with general members and got to know more fun facts about each other.  There were seven teams in total and we were all sent out in different breakout rooms with our teams where we completed the assigned activities. It was so much fun bonding with other members over a casual event and even got my competitive spirits fired up! At the end all the teams were called back from the breakout room and Team 4 (4TW) was crowned the winner. We hope everyone who attended this event got to meet new people and had a blast!
