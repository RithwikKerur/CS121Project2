Business Information Management
Why did you choose UC Irvine?
Because of its reputation. Though it may not have been at the top of everyone’s list at the time that I applied, UCI had shown tremendous growth and is making its way to the top and I found that remarkable
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
Building quality relationships with people. There is no way that I would be where I am without having learned more about knowing to treasure certain people in your lives and being able to give back to others when they need help. These relationships helped not only for my studies, but also learning about the what’s going around us in a much larger scale.
Have you done an internship? If so, where and in what role?
Currently, I am lucky enough to intern at Hobert Wealth Management, where I am a financial services assistant. Because of the company’s small size, I’ve been given the opportunity to help build the company internally. My major duties are preparing applications for clients as well as laying internal processes within the company to help it move effectively and efficiently. At the same time, I’ve been given the chance to both learn and do their bookkeeping. It is a constant learning experience that I’m growing to love.
Are you pursuing a minor or double major?
I’m trying to get my accounting minor, because I do enjoy understanding how companies work from the inside knowing how well a company is doing. And so far, the classes I’ve taken really help put me into perspective of why companies take certain actions that they do today.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
Currently, I’m one of the commissioners for the Visions Leadership Course hosted by the Academic Affairs Office in ASUCI. Also, I volunteer with the VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) Program again for next year’s income tax season. Both have their perks. My role in ASUCI is to help manage mentors who run the Visions Leadership Course at UCI. As commissioners, we help guide them to structuring their class and providing a strong backbone when they need the help. As a VITA volunteer, we get the chance to help low income families file their taxes and educate those that don’t know about the tax season about how it works.
What are you most proud of so far?
Just being at UC Irvine. I think being able to get the right education as well as meeting the people I’ve met here really drove me to become the person I am today.
What has been the best part of your experience?
Living in the residential halls of Middle Earth. I’ve met countless connections and had wonderful experiences living there.
What are your aspirations?
I aim to attain my CPA (certified public accountant) certification and be able to work in the taxation field as a corporate tax accountant or an internal auditing consultant.
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
Do not take the business information management major for granted, or any major for that matter. In my experience, you really get to see the best of both worlds of business administration and computer science. The major offers the crucial classes that you need to understand the fundamentals in each field. You’ll begin to realize much of the internal works of current-day businesses run on many of the underlying bases of these classes.
