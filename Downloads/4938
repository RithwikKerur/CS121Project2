WICS Summer Session Workshop 

 07/25/201310/09/2013admin























Wednesday, July 24, WICS hosted a workshop for high school students and incoming freshmen at UCI. More than 10 WICS members signed up to work with over 40 students on Snap Circuits and littleBits.
This workshop was intended to educate and provide insight to students who were interested in the technological field. With the support of the WICS members, students got to explore and create their own little electronic modules. Both WICS and the students got to learn and explore the numerous possibilities that came from these simple components.
