    				Innertube — a new CBS online channel    			


News.com reports that CBS is switching on a new broadband channel — Innertube.
The broadband channel will serve as a test ground for new types of shows.
Does this mean that regular broadcast channels have started really believing what many people have been saying — the nature of broadcast as we have known it is going to be the thing of the past.
