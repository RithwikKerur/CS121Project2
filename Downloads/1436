Project: MESSENGERS















Project: MESSENGERS
AND NAVIGATIONAL PROGRAMMING
This project is developing a new programming paradigm,
called Navigational Programming, for
distributed systems based on the principles of autonomously migrating
processes, called Messengers. Each
Messenger is able to migrate among nodes of a local area network using explicit
hop statements, which support strong migration. Unlike mobile agents used for a
variety of services on the Internet, the MESSENGERS system is intended for
general-purpose scientific computing. 
Some of the advantages of migrating processes, as compared to stationary
message-passing processes, are highlighted in the following Project
Summary.

There are two independent versions
of MESSENGERS: MESSENGERS-I, and MESSENGERS-C, where "I" stands for
"interpreted", and "C" stands for "compiled". The
MESSENGERS-C is faster than MESSENGERS-I, but MESSENGERS-I has a Virtual Time
support.
