Dutt's research is in the area of
  embedded systems and computer-aided design, with a specific focus on the
  exploration, evaluation and design of domain-specific embedded systems
  spanning both software and hardware. His group has developed a novel
  architectural description language that facilitates rapid exploration of
  programmable embedded systems, as well as automatic generation of software
  toolkits supporting embedded systems development (including optimizing
  compilers and simulators). Other projects within his group include
  cross-layer design and optimization of reliable, distributed embedded
  systems, memory architecture exploration for embedded systems, and
  brain-inspired architectures and computing.
