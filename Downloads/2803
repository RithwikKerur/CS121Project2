    				EventWeb is Born    			


Today Seraja went ‘live’ — meaning now you don’t need a password to visit www.seraja.com.
CONGRATULATIOS Team SEraja.  All the creative ideas and the heard work behind making them real is here in cyberspace now.  And it looks very good and very promising.
For the first time, there is a place for people to go beyond the ‘calendar of events’ — and make events real experiences.  And this is evolving into a web of events in which people will be able to immerse themselves and not only experience but also gain experiential insights.
I am thrilled.
