Gaussian Process Regression with Time-shifts



Examples from the paper

GPR, fixed timesGPR with timeshift




Overview
Time-course gene expression data sets provide important insights into dynamic aspects of biological processes such as  circadian rhythms, cell cycle, and organ development. 
A typical microarray time-course expression data set consists of
measurements taken at a relatively small number of time-points
(e.g., 5 to 10), where at each time-point microarray measurements
are obtained on a few (say, 3) replicate samples. There has been considerable work in recent years in bioinformatics on the development of statistical techniques for accurately inferring expression profiles
from such data, in the face of both measurement noise and biological variation across replicates.

However, a source of variation that has received little attention to date is uncertainty about the precise
biological time at which measurements were taken.  Specifically, replicates may be measured 
at the same chronological time, yet could be at different stages of development due to the replicate
individuals having developed at different rates.  Although the underlying true expression profiles for
each gene may be noisy, we can infer time-shifts for each replicate by analyzing all genes simultaneously.
In particular, we simultaneously estimate the profile shapes using a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model
and estimate the time shifts by a maximum a-posteriori optimization.

Code
This code implements a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with uncertainty in the independent axis (in our case, time).
