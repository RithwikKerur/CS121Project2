    				Happy to see MULTIMedia    			


Yesterday’s workshop on Multimedia Information Retrieval was very encouraging.  They had invited several people to share their research at the workshop — in addition to regular contributed papers.  For the first time at an academic meeting on Multimedia Information Retrieval, it was very pleasing to see that most invited speakers really did talk about MULTI and also emphasized the importance of using different sources of information.
This is truly a very refreshing change in the field.  I am ecstatic about this.
