			Aggregation

ABSTRACT:


The source of multicast communication needs to securely verify which 
multicast group members have received a multicast message, 
but verification of individually signed acknowledgments from each 
receiver imposes unnecessary computation and communication 
costs.  We propose a solution which allows the intermediate 
nodes along the multicast distribution tree to aggregate the authenticated 
acknowledgments sent by the multicast receivers to the source. 
Our solution consists of a new multisignature scheme, secure under the 
	discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model, which blends the 
	well-known Schnorr signature scheme with the Merkle hash tree structure. The 
	multisignature scheme we propose has a novel property of robustness, which 
	allows for an efficient multisignature generation even in the presence 
	of maliciously faulty nodes.
