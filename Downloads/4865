Winter Quarter 2017 Week 4: Crime and Mystery Game Night 

 02/01/201703/07/2017Diana Sandil



This past Wednesday February 1, WICS hosted an entertaining Crime and Mystery themed game night. WICS members had a fun bonding time with each other as they played “Murder in the Dark” and mafia. Around 30 WICS members attended this game night, which made playing these group games even that more fun! As we are approaching the middle of the quarter, this game night was a relaxing and entertaining way for WICS members to take a break from studying and have some laughs!
