May 23, 2018


A large crowd gathered to celebrate Informatics Professor David G. Kay and his 37 years of teaching on Monday, May 21, 2018.

May 16, 2018


“In general, there’s no hard data showing that people who are on Facebook are more or less productive. There is an argument to be made, however, that some Facebook use at work is associated with higher performance: in one study Gloria Mark of UC Irvine showed that Facebook use at work is associated with a more positive mood at the end of the workday.

May 8, 2018


The University of California Irvine (UCI) has begun planning their educational program to bring Korean coaches and players to the United States. Introduced by Constance, the professor broke down their intentions to bring Korean Esports representatives to Irvine to not only teach young Esports student enthusiasts at UCI but also help elongate their Esports careers.
