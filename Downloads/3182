    				Padma Vibhushan    			


Narayana Murthy, Ratan Tata, PRS Oberoi, and LN Mittal are among the people who have been honoured by Government of India by Padma Vibhusha — the second highes honour (the highest is Bharat Ratna).  Nice to see that Government has started honouring industrialist who are really behind the progress India is making and are really transforming India.

			One thought on “Padma Vibhushan”
