    				Folk Computing:  Sub $100 computer    			


On CNN International (sitting in my Singapore Hotel at 7:25 PM on Jan 3, 2006), I saw a pitch by N. Negroponte of MIT Media Labs on his computer that will be below $100 and will revolutionize use of computing among developing countries.  At the end of the program it was mentioned that this computer is not yet in production.    I have been hearing this pitch for quite some time now.
On the other hand, I spent yesterday with Rajesh Jain.  Who mentioned, in his typical low key style, that the company that he cofounded with Ray Strata and Ashok Jhunjhunwala ( www.novatium.com ) is already producing and expects to flood the market with sub $100 computers first in India and then in other developing countries.
