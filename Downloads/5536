July 12, 2019


On behalf of Chancellor Gillman, it is my privilege to announce that Gillian R. Hayes has been appointed vice provost for graduate education and dean of the Graduate Division, effective Sept. 1, 2019.
A member of the UCI faculty since 2007, she currently serves as the Robert A. and Barbara L.

The Atlantic: “The Slackification of the American Home ” (Melissa Mazmanian quoted)




 Melissa Mazmanian, an informatics professor at UC Irvine, agrees. “The way that we imagine knowledge work and more and more kinds of work is really about coordination and collaboration across distance, across people’s different time commitments, managing attention, figuring out who’s going to do what when,” she says. “And that style of work … It’s very similar to family life, if you think about it.” Perhaps one’s children and direct reports are not so different after all.

Relying on datasets to determine policies isn’t without its limitations. “The biggest problem is that it’s hard to condense experience into a dataset,” Lo says.

Wired: “Waze Data Can Help Predict Car Crashes and Cut Response Time” (Sean Young quoted)

July 8, 2019


That almost-three minutes of lead time might not always be the difference between life and death, says Sean Young, a professor of medicine at UCLA and UCI who serves as the executive director of the University of California Institute for Prediction Technology. But “if these methods can cut the response time down by between 20 to 60 percent, then it’s going to have the positive clinical impact,” he says. “It’s generally agreed upon that the faster you get into the emergency room, the better the clinical outcomes will be.”
