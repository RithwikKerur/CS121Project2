Winter 2022 Week 5: Life After UCI 

 02/07/2022admin



On Monday, January 31, 2022, of Week 5, WICS held a Life After UCI Meeting on Zoom. We were fortunate to have not one, but five of our alumni discuss their transition from college student to full time employee, maintenance of a work-life balance, as well as some tips on how to find and maintain old and new friendships. Their advice was very enlightening and informative to hear, since many of WICS’s own board and members are graduating seniors. Afterwards, a picture was taken of everyone, and everyone left feeling inspired by the advice of their fellow WICS alumni.
