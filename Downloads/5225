Winter 2021 Week 2: ACM x WICS Mock Technical Interview Prep 

 02/19/2021admin



This Monday on January 11, 2020, WICS collaborated with ACM to host a mock technical interview preparation session. Following the club introduction, everyone was placed into four to five groups where they got to solve coding problems. There were a total of three rotations with a question in each one. The winning teams based on correctness, time complexity, explanation, and collaboration were Group 7 for first place and Groups 5 and 6 tied for second place. At the end, there was an optional reflection where participants got to receive tips for interviews from proctors.
