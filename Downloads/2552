    				When in Where    			


Rajesh Jain sent me links to a blog and transcript of Interviews of Tim O’Reilly and Nathan Torkington describing what to expect in Where 2.0 conference later this month.  Interesting perspectives on Where.  Clearly ‘location’ is becoming important and will be emphasized at Where.  They also talk about the role of When in this.  
I will be making a presentation on some ideas related to Events at this conference — and they mention that also in this Interview.  I will discuss more about what I will present here — my thinking about it etc in next two weeks.
In any case, here are the links:
