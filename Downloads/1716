Add some stuff here.

Curve Matching

Belief propagation

Image segmentation
Peter Kovesi's MATLAB code for vision and image processing
Link -- The section titled "Edge linking and line segment fitting" seems like it may be especially useful.  I fed it a perfect outline of a piece, and it converted it to a sequence of line segments and returned the coordinates of each vertex along the path.  Nice.
MATLAB can perform all sorts of useful magic.  For example -- given a nasty, thick, outline of a puzzle piece, you may want to consider bwmorph(img,'thin').  It can also find edges in grayscale images.  Who knew?  I submit to you the slyly-named edge function.
