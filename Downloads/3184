    				Face recognition — one more claim    			


There is a claim 6that a system can solve face recognition problem using just one photo.  See a brief announcement here.   Such claims have appeared in context of object recognition in general and face recognition in particular.  Based on the history, I have difficulty believing, but thought of sharing this.

Strong claims on face recognition abound.  Here is one published in “Science” a week ago:
