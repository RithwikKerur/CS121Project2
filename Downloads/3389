    				Reverse Search is just Search    			


I have seen a few people use the term ‘reverse search’ for searches performed by engines like shazam.com.  I find it very awkward term.
Maybe it is just me.
I feel that people are so much used to living in the ‘keyword box’ that the fresh air offered by other modes to search are considered different from search.  In shazam, the engine listens to a piece of music and searches for it and gives search results.  If we need to invent a term for this, we should just call it query by example.
I was disturbed by the term because it clearly is used without really thinking what is going on.
