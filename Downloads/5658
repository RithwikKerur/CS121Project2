Software Engineering
Why did you choose UC Irvine for your studies?
After applying to a number of California universities, my wife and I (both returning students) took a trip through California to visit the campuses we were most interested in. UC Irvine was our last stop before heading back to the bay area, where we lived at the time.
Some of the campuses were depressing, others nice but in bad areas. None were quite right. When we stopped here, though, we both fell in love with it. Aldrich Park was beautiful, the campus clean, Irvine burby but safe (the opposite of where we lived at the time). It felt like a place we could call home.
When both of our offers came in, we were ecstatic. Nearly two years later, we are just as happy with our decision. The people here, students and staff, are really friendly and approachable. Classes are rigorous but fair. The school is large but feels small.
What is the most enjoyable part of your studies?
I really appreciate the breadth of classes available to me. Though most of the courses in the Software Engineering major are required, I would have taken them all were they only available as electives. In fact, that is the primary reason I switched from Computer Science to Software Engineering: the electives I was choosing to be part of my CS degree were already part of SE! From operating systems to networking, requirements analysis to program management, Python to C++, it’s all there.
Have you done an internship?
This past summer, I interned at a local medical devices company. Using the Python skills I learned in my first year, I was given the task of automating a number of server-related tasks which used to require frequent human intervention. I even taught a class in Python for their software team! Through my internship, I gained a better understanding of how to apply my skills in the ‘real world’ and got a priceless glimpse into a working software development operation.
Are you engaged in any social activities outside of your studies?
In a word (or two), not really. I treat my education as a full-time job, which is good because it really is! This quarter I learned about Parkinson’s Law, which states “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” I have provided that space and schoolwork has filled it. But I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m only here for a few years and I want to learn as much as I possibly can in that time.
That being said, I have made more friends here at UCI than I have anywhere else and when I do have free time, it’s great to hang out with them. The beach is ten minutes away and there are quite a few good eateries around if you know where to look.
What are you most proud of so far?
One fear I had coming here was that I would be out of my depth. I was a career changer who had always loved computers but had little programming experience. I knew that there would be kids here who had been coding since they were six.
What I know now is that the programming gap closes relatively quickly and that there is far more to software than just programming. Some of my favorite classes so far have dealt with the design of software, everything from ideation to UX, architecture to implementation. Programming is a small (but really fun!) part of a much larger world.
Mostly, I have learned that if I put my heart and mind into something I will excel at it, that feeling fear is a normal part of learning and has nothing to do my ability to learn. This I’m most proud of.
What has been the best part of your experience?
I never would have imagined five years ago that I would be here now, at UCI, a year away from attaining my B.S. in Software Engineering. Five years ago I suffered a back injury which ended a prospective career in the culinary industry. It was difficult to see past rehabilitation, let alone to a new career. Getting my bachelor’s degree seemed like a pipe dream at the time, but I started small, taking classes at community college until I was ready to transfer.
It’s been a long road. I’m close to the end of this one, the beginning of another. The best part of my experience of UCI is simply being at UCI.
What are your aspirations?
I have discovered through my courses (and internship) the field of software architecture. I feel that my values and proclivities match up well with those needed to succeed in the field. I am also really enjoying learning about, and performing, project management. And I love coding, too!
Basically, I want to be good at everything but expect that my path will eventually lead toward technical management (after spending plenty of time in the trenches, I’m sure!)
What would your advice be to incoming students in your program?
Talk to people around you in class, especially during your first year. Most transfers and freshman have to take the year-long Python series as soon as they get here, so it’s a built-in opportunity to make friends with people who are in the same boat as you.
As far as school goes, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of information coming at you from every angle: surveys, seminars, opportunities to get involved, tasks, updates, messageboard posts, schedule changes, the latest news. You would be well-served by using, at minimum, a calendar app – ideally, a calendar, task, and note app – to keep everything organized. When something comes in, scan it then either delete it or input it. It will help prevent things from slipping through the cracks and allow you to concentrate on the things that really matter.
Most of all, have fun! UCI is a great school, the local beaches are world-class, there’s a super-cheap theater nearby, and more “$2 boba” than you can shake a stick at.
