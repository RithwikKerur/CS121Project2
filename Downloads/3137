    				If I.T. merged with E. T.    			


Trevor Sharpe sent me this link to an article by Thomas Friedman — yes the same Friedman who popularized The Flat World.  An interesting article on technology situation in India.  The part that caught my attention was the early part:
Well, hereâ€™s something you donâ€™t see every day. I was visiting an Indian village 350 miles east of Hyderabad and got to watch a very elderly Indian man undergo an EKG in a remote clinic, while a heart specialist, hundreds of miles away in Bangalore, watched via satellite TV and dispensed a diagnosis. This kind of telemedicine is the I.T. revolution at its best. But what struck me most was that just underneath the TV screen, powering the whole endeavor, were 16 car batteries â€” the E.T., energy technology, revolution, at its worst.
