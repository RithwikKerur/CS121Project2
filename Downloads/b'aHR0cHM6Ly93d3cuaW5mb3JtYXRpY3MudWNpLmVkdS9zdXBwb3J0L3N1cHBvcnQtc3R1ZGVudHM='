Support Students


Our students are among the nation’s best and brightest. Their passion, energy and ingenuity are reshaping our understanding of and interaction with the digital world around us.
Many of these promising scholars – a significant portion of whom are the first in their families to go to college – face serious financial challenges. Supporting their development is one of our top priorities.
By sponsoring an undergraduate scholarship or graduate fellowship, Informatics donors can help deserving students afford a quality education and demonstrate their commitment to the future of information technology.
Donor-sponsored programs may be designated as one-time awards, annual scholarships or fellowships, or endowments. Donors play an instrumental role in establishing the program criteria and participating in the selection process. Scholarships and fellowships may be named for corporations or other organizations, in memory of friends and loved ones, in recognition of the donor, or simply remain anonymous.
Contact our department chair to get involved or learn more.
The Kay Family Foundation donated the funds to outfit one of the student labs with high-end technology to promote collaboration and innovation.
