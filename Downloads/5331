Just Code It 

 06/28/202006/30/2020admin



“Just Code It!” is a 4-week program was organized by WICS’s Community Outreach committee. We are experienced in creating curriculum geared towards encouraging underrepresented minorities to explore STEM, and Just Code It! focuses on introducing web development basics to girls in middle-school and high-school. The program covers more hands-on, technical aspects of computer science such as basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and it is intended to help bridge the gender gap in all roles of computer science for future generations. Through Just Code It!, we hope to provide a fun and engaging program for middle school girls to be introduced to computer science, a quickly growing field, so that they may consider a career in technology.
