SEWORLD @ SDCL 



The SDCL is now in charge of moderating and administrating the ACM SIGSOFT SEWORLD mailing list.  The mailing list, started over 15 years ago at the University of Colorado at Boulder, serves the Software Engineering community through the dissemination of time-sensitive information relevant to the field of software engineering research (http://www.sigsoft.org/seworld/). We are very exited to be able to support the Software Engineering community in this role!
