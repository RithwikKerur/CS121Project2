    				Arun Hampapur — Distinguished Engineer at IBM    			


Arun Hampapur has been recognized as a Distinguished Engineer at IBM.
Distinguished Engineer’s  are one grade below IBM Fellow.   Of the 220K technical professionals in IBM,  there are 520 DE’s.  This is also an executive position within the IBM company.   Arun has been recognized for his work on Video Surveillance.
I am proud to see that he has been recognized so soon — it appears as if he was finishing his PhD just recently at Michigan — in fact he was my last PhD student to graduate from Michigan.  It does give you a good feeling when your academic offsprings do well. 
Thanks, Arun, for giving me this great feeling.
