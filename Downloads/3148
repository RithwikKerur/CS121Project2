    				Places coming to Flickr    			


Flickr is introducing a feature called places — this will give photos taken at a place.  You should be able to search based on the name of a place and find photos taken there.
Photo organization is an important problem and digital cameras have made it a ‘hot’ problem.  This is definitely a nice feature.  Once cameras get GPS, this will become a good method to use.  Most photo management systems already allow organization based on time.  Place based organization will make it more convenient.  And then we will get to real event-based organization.
