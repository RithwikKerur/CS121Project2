Graduate Student Spotlight: Elizabeth Ankrah Explores Tech for ‘Care Journeys’

March 9, 2021



When Elizabeth Ankrah was younger, she considered following in her father’s footsteps and becoming a nurse, or maybe even a doctor. Instead, she took a different route to healthcare, earning her bachelor’s degree in bioengineering from George Mason University, with a concentration in healthcare informatics. Now, as a second-year Ph.D. student in UCI’s Department of Informatics and a member of the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) group, she is exploring socio-technical interventions for people in need of chronic care.

February 23, 2021


Dr. Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist and professor at the University of California, Irvine studying youth and new media practices, has done research focusing on creative and learning communities that surround complex games such as Starcraft, Little Big Planet, Minecraft, and Roblox. 
“We found that young people, when engaged in these affinity groups and online communities, are learning a wide range of technical, academic, and digital citizenship skills and knowledge,” Ito said in an email interview. “This can range from organizing complex team play, creating and editing videos, or building their own games.”

New World Notes: “Bored With Zoom, Professor Teaches Computer Programming In A Virtual World, And Streams It To Her Twitch — Here’s Her Advice For Other Educators” (Crista Lopes quoted)

February 12, 2021


Starting at 12:30pm PT today, you can watch this Twitch channel to see yet another clever solution to teaching a large group of students in quarantine times: UC Irvine computer scientist Crista Lopes, being “sick and tired of teaching in Zoom”, moved her class of 150 students to OpenSimulator, an open source virtual world. And not just to stream a video lecture to an assembly of avatars, but using OpenSim’s scripting functionality so students could actually learn programming by using the virtual world’s language, and building applications within it.

PsyPost: “Trump’s tweets linked to changes in Americans’ beliefs about the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic” (Sean Young quoted)




New research from the University of California at Irvine suggests that Donald Trump’s tweets influenced the spread of misinformation about COVID-19. The study, which appears in JAMA Network Open, examined social media data from Twitter to capture changes in the public’s coronavirus-related attitudes.
“I’m interested in creative ways to help people and save lives. A broad major problem stopping public health from saving lives is that it takes a long time to learn who needs help,” said study author Sean D. Young, an associate professor and executive director of the UC Institute for Prediction Technology. “Monitoring near-real time data sources like social media, especially among influencers, can help solve that problem.”

Graduate Student Spotlight: Nika Nour’s Unique Background Fortifies Battle Against Online Misinformation

February 3, 2021



Success as a young chess player helped Nika Nour test into college at age 14 — but don’t compare her to chess prodigy Beth Harmon of the hit Netflix show “The Queen’s Gambit.” “Harmon was acknowledged for her success. The men didn’t retaliate for her winning. All of a sudden, all these dudes call in to make sure she’s a champion. It’s obviously fiction!” Nour says laughing. “I grew up playing chess since I was four, and I was completely berated for loving this sport.”

KPCC AirTalk: “Acknowledging, Assessing And Addressing Racism Within The Fantasy Genre” (Aaron Trammell featured)

January 28, 2021


The fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons has editions that date back to the 1970s. While the game is made up of mythical characters and spells that can be cast, its depiction of race and gender are anything but a fantasy. 
The Dungeon Master uses the rule book to narrate the story that allows players to decide the actions of their characters. According to a recent piece in WIRED, “genetic determinism is a fantasy tradition.” Game makers are starting to grapple with the deeply ingrained stereotyping that exists. But experts recognize that changing a few rules here and there only goes so far. So where does the fantasy genre of gaming go from here and how can it increase representation?
