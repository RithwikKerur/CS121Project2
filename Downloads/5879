Graduate Student Policies: Residency Requirements

Residency Requirement
A minimum of six quarters for Ph.D. students or three quarters for M.S. students in academic residence is required prior to the award of the degree. Typically, a longer period of study (two to six years) is required for completion of all degree requirements.
After a Ph.D. student has been registered for over 21 quarters (seven years), and a M.S. student has been registered for over six quarters (two years), they are considered to be beyond normative time for completing the degree.
A letter regarding this status is sent to the student and to the department requesting a deadline be implemented for the student to complete all requirements and submit their dissertation. If this deadline is missed the student is subject to academic disqualification.
