30-day Evaluation Licenses

VMware


VMware licensing is no longer available site-wide as VMware has forced its educationally purposed programs into a cost per user basis. As a result of this, ICS is no longer able to purchase licensing for all ICS affiliated users. Availability of VMware licenses will only be offered to specific ICS courses actively requiring VMware programs. 


30-day Evaluation Licenses


Publicly available 30 day licenses can be found in the following page:   


https://www.vmware.com/try-vmware.html


For Workstation Pro and Fusion Pro, expand the Desktop Hypervisor section under the Select a Product Trial area midway in the above link. The downloads at the bottom of the Workstation and Fusion pages is the same fully featured software used for both the evaluation and the licenses purchased by ICS. Evaluation licenses provide the same full set of functions as the purchased licenses. 


Please note that the first few weeks in ICS courses will use the 30 days license before users are provided purchased licenses. This is to account for users who drop the course. 


VMware in Computing Labs


Fully licensed installations of VMware Workstation Pro are available for use for those with an active ICS account in the  Windows based computing labs located in CS 364, 183, 189, and 192.
