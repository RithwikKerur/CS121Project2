    				Another Non-issue gaining importance    			


It’s amazing that there could be so many political groups protesting against a movie.
See stories on the movie — Jodha Akbar.  Here is one.

Interesting to see Mr. Jain. Here in The Netherlands we now have a movie called Fitha about Moslims in Europe. 
All political groups ask the politician who made it, not broadcasting it. If it will, I am sure it will reach every country in the world in a controverse way…

I think it’s very interesting to see why this news didn’t reach the whole world. It seems that some of these news items are just dropped as unimportant… Very strange imo..
