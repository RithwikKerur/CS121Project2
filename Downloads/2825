    				Techies are coming back!    			


A recent report says
Being labelled a techie used to be an impediment to advancement, but by 2010 technical skills will be more highly prized than ever, according to a study by management consultants Deloitte.
Looks like they are talking about USA when they say:
“Many nations may be facing employment crisis by 2010, with the most acute shortages being in IT workers. Companies, governments and employment authorities should consider acting sooner rather than later to ensure that investments in technology are matched by investments in skills,” said Deloitte.
