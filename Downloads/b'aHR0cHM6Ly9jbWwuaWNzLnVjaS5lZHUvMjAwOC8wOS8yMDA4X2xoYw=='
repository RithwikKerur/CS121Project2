Center Member Applies Machine Learning to Large Hadron Collider Standard

September 2, 2008
News



Along with six other UCI faculty members, Center member Daniel Whiteson, an assistant professor in physics & astronomy, is playing a key role in the Large Hadron Collider, the worldﾒs most powerful particle accelerator.  Whiteson’s primary role is to ensure that data acquisition operates smoothly over 2,000 computers operating in parallel.  Whiteson’s research includes the use of machine learning techniques to sift through huge amounts of proton-proton collision data, in order to look for evidence of the Higgs boson or other fundamentally new particles.
