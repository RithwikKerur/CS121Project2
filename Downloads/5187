WICS Fall Quarter Week 3: Amazon Workshop 

 11/02/201811/02/2018admin



On Wednesday, October 17th, WICS hosted an Amazon Workshop at the Student Center. We had over 60 attendees come and hear about opportunities at Amazon as well as one of Amazon’s Engineer’s background! Our speaker, Lanvi, shared her journey on how she became an intern at Amazon and converted into a full-time engineer. She also shared some encouraging words of wisdom and made sure everyone knew to never give up! At the end of the event, she allowed time for a Q&A session and students were also able to personally go up and speak to her. We enjoy having Amazon host events with us throughout the year and look forward to events with them in the future! Thank you to those who attended and we look forward to seeing those who could not at our next event!
