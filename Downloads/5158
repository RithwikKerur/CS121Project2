Fall 2021 Week 10: WICSgiving 

 12/16/202112/16/2021admin



During Monday of Week 10, WICS held its last event of the quarter: a WICSgiving event to bring our community of board, committee and general members together with some good food, fun games, and good times. After a brief overview of the event, and congratulating our graduating seniors, we dove into the variety of potluck items in front of us from delicious European cookies to the cheesiest pizzas. We also got to witness some friendly competition with games like Pin the Hat on the Turkey and prizes for the most creative, handmade crafts. At the end of the night, everybody left feeling less stressed about the upcoming finals week.
