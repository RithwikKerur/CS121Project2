WICS Winter Quarter Week 5: VMWare’s Networking Night 

 02/05/202002/09/2020admin



On Monday, February 3rd, WICS welcomed representatives from VMWare to talk about their company and take audience questions. There were over 60 RSVPs for the event and everyone was excited to learn more about VMWare and the opportunities they have for students. After everyone grabbed a slice of pizza courtesy of VMWare, they listened to a presentation by the VMWare representatives. After the presentation, the representatives participated in an engaging panel discussion with questions coming from the audience. At the end of the discussion, a speaker was given as a prize to the WICS member that asked the best questions and everyone got to take home some VMWare swag!
