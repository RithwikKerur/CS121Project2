 Research areas:


 Dr. Ban Al-Ani is a project scientist at UCI ICS. Her research focuses on understanding users of technology in different contexts. This has led her to research civilians’ use of information and communication technologies during violent conflict, developers who work in distributed teams, programmers using eclipse platform, and more recently volunteer coordinators in non-profit organizations. All these research projects focus on understanding people and defining their needs accordingly. Ban’s previous studies of computer science/systems and her ongoing study of human-computer-interaction (HCI) has enabled her to bridge between the disciplines of software engineering and HCI.
