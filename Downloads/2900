    				Seraja Updates: September 18, 2006    			


I was in Bangalore visiting Seraja team.Â  It was a pleasure to see that finally we are at a point that most of the basic technology will be in place very soon.Â  Now we have to focus onÂ content – both the one that our team will get and the one that will be created by people.Â  We are making good progress in terms of the speed at which we can now add events and reports.Â  By the way, we now have more than 100,000 events and 200,000 reports.Â  This number will increase rapidly first due to semiautomatic crawling and then by user generated content.Â  Our event entry tools are going thru final stage of testing and will be released soon.
Seraja is also available on mobile at m.seraja.com.Â  Tis is still the first generation.Â  This will imporve soon.Â  More importantly we are really interested in seeing how mobile devices can be used more effectively.Â  Ultimately those are the future.
Overall, Seraja is now close to being launched.Â  It will be launched first in India and then in USA.Â  And then in all other countries.
