Mentorship Program 








Every year WICS hosts a mentorship program. We pair up upperclassmen mentors with underclassmen in ICS. Our mentors provide not just tutoring, but moral support and general guidance. Many of our mentors and mentees have become good friends and stay in touch long after our program ends! Mentees benefit significantly for having experienced and relatable guidance in their first years, and our mentors can stand out to companies by working with our organization.
This year, our mentorship program is using the family system, where each family consists of three mentors and six mentees. This way, mentors will be accompanied by their co-mentors during the program, and mentees are able to bond with the others in the family as well.
WICS’ Mentorship program is NOW OPEN for the school of ICS and related majors. 
We are currently accepting MENTORS ONLY until Monday, October 17, 2022. Please message wics.uci.vp@gmail.com for any questions. If you’re interested, please fill out the preference form and add your profile to the mentor slide deck:
