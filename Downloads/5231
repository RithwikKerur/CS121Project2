Winter 2021 Week 9: Self Care Session 

 03/02/202104/23/2021admin



This Monday, March 1st 2021, WICS held a self-care session to encourage students to take a break during this stressful time of the quarter. Members were able to join various breakout rooms dedicated to different self-care activities. One breakout room was dedicated to Jigsaw Puzzles, another to origami, another to painting, and the fourth and final room was dedicated to Physical self-care. Between the 2 rounds of self-care, the entire group reconvened so that members from each breakout room could talk about what they had done during the round. During the break, members were also able to see each other’s zoom paintings, virtual jigsaw puzzles, and origami projects.
