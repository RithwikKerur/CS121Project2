WICS Fall Quarter Week 2: Zillow ‘Pitch Yourself’ Workshop 

 10/30/2020admin



On Wednesday, October 14th 2020 of Week 2, Zillow in collaboration with WICS hosted a “Pitch Yourself” Workshop, encouraging students to pursue their passions and develop skills to express themselves and stand out in the virtual recruiting season. Guest speaker Monique DeDonker, Senior Technical Recruiter at Zillow Group, led a workshop providing information and insight on how to effectively create pitches, centered around finding and communicating skills and accomplishments that students already have. For the second half of the workshop, students had the opportunity to share their pitches for review, as well as ask questions about virtual recruiting and career fairs in a Q&A session!
