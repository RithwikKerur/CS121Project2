Search




A search for more than one word will find pages that contain all of the words.
Use quotation marks to search for a phrase.  
Also use quotes for text with punctuation or special characters.
Searches are case insensitive, but accent sensitive in the default configuration (i.e. 'u' is not the same as 'Ã¹').

To limit your search to a single group, enter the group name followed by a slash at the beginning of the search string (e.g., "PmWiki/" or "Site/").  
To list all pages, enter a slash for the search.
