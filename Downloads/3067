    				Digital Camera Sensitivity    			


Kodak has announced a major breakthrough in designing digital cameras.Â  A news.com story reports:
Eastman Kodak has developed a relatively straightforward change to digital camera image sensors that could help with a major photography bugaboo: poor performance in dim conditions. 
The new technology, to be unveiled Thursday and used in products in 2008, increases light sensitivity of existing image sensors by a factor of two to four, said Mike DeLuca, marketing manager for Eastman Kodak’s image sensor solutions group.
Digital cameras continue to improve the way we record visual experiences.Â  And it is nice to see Kodak becoming again a leader in Photography — again bringing ‘Kodak moments back.
