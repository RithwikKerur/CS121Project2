Education:
2021 – Ph.D in Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA2016 – Laurea Magistrale (eq. Msc) in Computer Engineering, University of Padova, Italy2014 – Laurea Triennale (eq. Bsc) in Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy
While pursuing my Ph.D in Computer Science at University of California Irvine, I have worked on Machine Learning in heterogeneous Computer Systems. I focused on how to make Sensor Networks more reliable and efficient through architecture design, studying and implementing real-time systems.
Since the participation to the DARPA HackFest 2017, in joint team guided by Prof. Levorato and Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari, teaching at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, I have been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as an application of my studies. These devices, characterized by high mobility, time constraints and limited energy availability, offer a great opportunity for researching my topics of interest.
TA and mentorship
I helped delivering high quality courses in UC Irvine during A.Y.s 2016-17 and 2017-18, helping as a Teaching Assistant in Intermediate Python (ICS 33), Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 173a), Computer and Commincation Networks (CS 132-232) (both undergraduate and graduate level).
During my time as a graduate student, I mentored more than 20 undergraduate and graduate students, leading undergraduate research projects and senior projects that won 4 Undergraduate Research Awards (collectively more than $4000). I also mentored 3 graduate students: one master thesis project, two visiting and joining our research group (who joined the Ph.D program in UC Irvine).
