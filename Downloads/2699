    				Sourav Ganguli ISSUE    			


India’s parliament discusses selection decisions in a sports team (Cricket) seems a simple issue blown out-of-proportion even to a cricket fan like me.  Combine this with all the demonstrations and attention being given to this issue — including this post — and you have a puzzle.  I don’t understand how this issue gets more attention than I have seen infrastructure issues in Banglore get.  I am trying to ‘compute’ this in my head to understand.

It certainly is overkill. I was recently in India and realized the extent to which media coverage has blown up this issue. 
On the flip side, I believe that this kind of media coverage is good but is only the beginning. I have watched how some of this pattern of media attention has put the corrupt public officials in the docks.

they brought for Indian crowd â€¦. â€¦..If you support truth and
justiceâ€¦.. and  you can rise over all parochial regional feelings,
class, and clanâ€¦…if you have courage to call a spade a
spadeâ€¦…..and if you are not a puppet in the hand of media and
its “mass – opinion -engineering” style, then â€¦â€¦ ….kindly visit the
site:

10 odd days to bring the ideas into reality. A plethora of good
information and statistics on Sourav Ganguly is given to shut the
mouth of so called anti-Souravian politics.
