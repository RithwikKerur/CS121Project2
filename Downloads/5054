WICS Fall Quarter Week 3: WICS Games 

 10/16/2019admin



On October 15, 2019, WICS hosted its annual event “WICS Games!” Company representatives from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Raytheon, Twilio, and Paciolian joined WICS members in a night of networking and solving puzzles. Before the games started, participants got to enjoy some delicious food from Stone Fire Grill while networking with company representatives and other participants. There were 9 teams and 3 rounds and each team had a company representative as a mentor. The problems ranged ranged in difficulty, and everyone had a great time finding solutions together! At the end of the night everyone got to go home with free company swag, with the first, second, and third place teams getting more swag. Thank you so much to the company representatives for joining us; everyone had an amazing time!
