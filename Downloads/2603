    				New house — filled with boxes    			


We are in our home in Irvine.
Whren you move you realize how much junk you have collected.  ANd you keep collecting more — thinking that some day you will need that book that you have not opened in the last 29 years or that bag that you did not touch in the last 17 years or …. you get the picture.
Hopefully in the next 3-4 days things will get back to normal.  Right now it is a mess.

judging from all the  boxes we had in the irvine house if an environmentalist walked in our house they would have a heart attack.  I remember in the reedley house we used a box as a table until we got our wooden kitchen table. take care dad
