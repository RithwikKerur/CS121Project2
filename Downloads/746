Press Release: UC Irvine Launches Executive Master’s Program in Human-Computer Interaction & Design
April 27, 2016


UC Irvine’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) has announced the launch of a Master of Human-Computer Interaction and Design (MHCID). Housed in the Department of Informatics, the new MHCID offers the world’s only low-residency one-year master’s program that combines the benefits of a high-touch on-campus experience with the flexibility of online learning. The new accelerated program has just started accepting applications for its first cohort of graduate students who will begin this fall.

“We listened to our Advisory Board, got feedback from the world’s largest UX employers, and built on our world-class research to custom design a program for today’s competitive employment landscape,” said Robert A. and Barbara L. Kleist Professor in Informatics Gillian Hayes, who is also the faculty director for the MHCID program. 
Focusing on professional education, the MHCID is an interdisciplinary degree that builds on the strengths from multiple schools across the UC Irvine campus, including the arts, business, education and humanities. The program brings together design, technology and the study of human behavior to prepare its graduates to be leaders in user experience research and design, interaction design, information architecture, product design and human-computer interaction. 
“User experience and design is one of the fastest growing specialties in business today and we believe that our students will bring unique strengths and abilities to the field,” said Hal Stern, Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean of the Bren School of ICS.
The MHCID program’s innovative curriculum consists of nine courses and a capstone project that will enable students to graduate having developed an extensive portfolio of their work. Through a project-based curriculum, MHCID students will work in small teams to solve real-world problems and collaborate with industry partners to innovate, improve or modify a new or existing human-to-machine technology. The MHCID program will also expose students to a broad range of networking activities through UCI’s alumni network and through interactions with the program’s industry and academic advisory boards. To learn more about the MHCID program, visit http://mhcid.ics.uci.edu. 
CHI Conference Media:
Members of the press who are attending the ACM CHI 2016 Conference in San Jose, Calif., are welcome to attend the UC Irvine Informatics CHI Party on May 10 from 7-10 p.m. at Paper Plane, where we will be celebrating the launch of the MHCID program. Please RSVP for the party here.
