WICS Spring Quarter Week 5: Yoga and Study Session+Ice cream 

 04/30/201809/25/2018admin



On Monday, April 30th, the last day of April, WICS held a Yoga and Study session to help students release stress at DBH 6011. We had Ms. Natalie D’Azzo, the wellness & peer education programs manager from UCI Student Wellness and Health Promotion, to lead the Yoga session from 6-7pm. Around 14 people joined our Yoga session, we had a relaxing and peaceful yoga time with Natalie. Everyone said they enjoyed it. After the Yoga session, a lot of people came in for the study session. More than 40 people were in the room studying and mingling with friends. We had ice cream, cookies and popcorn. The study session ended around 8:30pm. Overall, it was a long but successful event!
