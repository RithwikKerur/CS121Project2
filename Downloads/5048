WICS Spring Quarter Week 7: Slalom Tour 

 06/03/201908/21/2019admin



On Friday, May 17th, WICS members went to tour at the Slalom office in Irvine! We were greeted by Mike Hernandez and the Technology Enablement team, who showed us around the office and gave us a presentation of what they do as a business and consulting firm. We had a lunch-and-learn and also got some cool swag bags to take home! Thanks to everyone at Slalom who helped us on the tour, it was really insightful!
