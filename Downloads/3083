    				CNN YouTube Debates    			


Who could imagine just a year (or much less say 6 months) ago that there will be an event called CNN YouTube debates that will be very popular (for example see the story in News.com)?
YouTube has definitely become an example company in many ways.Â  In addition to bringing video to masses and making it so popular, the other thing it demonstrated is the ‘copyright’ issues in the modern world.Â  By being bold and working on the boundries in exploiting the law, it built a company that several, including Mark Cuban, thought was impossible.Â  They have definitely demonstrated how an entrepreneurial company can really benefit by playing at the boundaries.
