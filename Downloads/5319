Merging Music with Technology


Jan. 12, 2018 — Music and technology make up the two largest areas in my life. As an informatics student, I have a passion for programming and human-centered design. Outside of class, I study the Japanese koto instrument and host an electronic music show on KUCI radio.
Thanks to UCI’s Multidisciplinary Design Program (MDP), I now have the opportunity to marry my two passions. As part of the 2017–2018 MDP, I will be working with Professor Mari Kimura and Dr. Michael Klopfer to develop “Mugic,” a wearable sensor for musicians to monitor technique during live performance. Our team consists of five students from departments in Engineering, Music and Information & Computer Sciences.
MDP stresses the value of interdisciplinary learning. Each project in MDP brings together a diverse group of faculty and students to solve complex problems. There is something exciting about merging opposite fields and working with people whose perspectives differ from your own.
I look forward to applying the skills gained through my informatics classes and former music experience to the Mugic project. As is the case with all MDP projects, I expect to learn most while interacting with team members and bouncing ideas off students and professors.
Experimenting with new technologies and combining different fields has always been one of UCI's strengths, and I am excited to be a part of this trend through the MDP experience.
Emma Anderson is a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Informatics at UC Irvine’s Donald Bren School of Computer Sciences.
