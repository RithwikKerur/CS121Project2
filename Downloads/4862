Winter Quarter 2017 Week 7: Intuit Interactive Hackathon Prep 

 02/21/201703/07/2017Diana Sandil



On Tuesday, February 21th, WICS teamed up with Hack at UCI and held its Intuit Interactive Hackathon Prep workshop. We had an outstanding turnout of about 45 participants that were excited to be there and learn more! Intuit provided many tips on how to have a successful hackathon. They also had the group go through several group exercises like creating their own prototype! Everyone was Intuit (in to it)!!! ðŸ™‚ While groups were working on the exercises, Intuit employees were providing guidance along the way. Overall, the event was successful and everyone definitely enjoyed themselves and gained more insight on how to have a great hackathon! We hope to have you at our future meetings, you are more than welcome!
