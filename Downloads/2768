    				Creators, synthesizers, and consumers    			


Bradley Horowitz has a nice post on emerging social aspects on the Web.  He says something really important:
In the new paradigm of â€œprogrammingâ€? where there are a million things on at any instant, weâ€™re going to need some new and different models of directing our attention.  In the transition from atoms-to-bits, scarcity-to-plenty, etc. instead of some cigar-puffing fat-cat at a studio or label â€œstoking the star-maker machinery behind the popular songsâ€? weâ€™re going to have the ability to create dynamic affinity based â€œchannelsâ€?.  
Good job Bradley.
