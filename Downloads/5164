Winter 2022 Week 7: Mentorship Madness 

 03/02/2022admin



On Friday, February 18, 2022, WICS held the Mentorship Madness. Mentors and mentees were all excited because this was the first in-person mentorship social in the Winter Quarter of 2022! Each member sat at the table with their mentorship family members for the three rounds of activities. The three rounds were so much fun including Family Synergy Test, Pictionary, which was drawing based on memorization, and Charades. Mentors and mentees enjoyed the event a lot! Through this social event, members also got to know each other better!
