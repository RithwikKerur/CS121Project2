    				Women Accepting Wife Beating    			


Times of India has a story that I found ‘shocking’ but on deliberating on it found it also not very surprising.Â  This is a comprehensive survey.
If you thought domestic violence was on the wane in India with the rise in education levels, take a look at these hard figures. Over 40% of women in a nationwide survey reported being beaten by their husbands at some point of time. More shockingly, around 54% of the women surveyed thought that such violence was justified on one ground or the other. 
It shows that social systems take time to change — they evolve slowly with education and new cultural influences.
