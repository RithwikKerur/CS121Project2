Huffington Post: “Agile Innovation for Jobs of The Future” (Mark quoted)

September 7, 2016



If we react to every single stimulus we receive, we will never get anything done.


For example, studies have indicated that on average three minutes pass by before an employee gets interrupted or switches to a new task. And usually after interruption it takes us around 23 minutes to get back to the state of flow and performance we had before the interruption.


Gloria Mark, professor at the University of California, Irvine elaborated on the aforementioned research results with the thought, ‘’We don’t have work days – we have work minutes that last all day.’’

Bowker awarded two NSF grants for big data research

August 31, 2016


Geoffrey Bowker, informatics professor and director of UC Irvine’s Values in Design Lab, was awarded two National Science Foundation (NSF) grants totaling more than $632,000 to support his project, “Collaborative Research: Institutionalizing the Data Sciences, a Sociotechnical Investigation of BDHubs.” 
Bowker’s work will focus on big data and the process of collecting and analyzing data in university curricula, state governance and industry strategy. “This project will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government,” wrote Bowker.
The grants are set to run between August 2016 and July 2019. Bowker will be working in collaboration with David M. Ribes of the University of Washington on the project.





Informatics accepting applications for Tenured Faculty Position in Digital Media, Learning, and Design

The Conversation: “Apple is taking its first steps towards a more comprehensive post-PC world” by Michael Cowling

July 26, 2016


If you’re creating an app for an iPad, then why not create it on an iPad too. Is Apple’s Swift move to do this just another step towards the end of the personal computer?

Quartz: “Neuroscientists say multitasking literally drains the energy reserves of your brain” (Mark quoted)

July 25, 2016


Gloria Mark, professor in the department of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, says that when people are interrupted, it typically takes 23 minutes and 15 seconds to return to their work, and most people will do two intervening tasks before going back to their original project. This switching leads to a build up of stress, she says, and so little wonder people who have high rates of neuroticism, impulsivity, and are susceptible to stress tend to switch tasks more than others.

The Atlantic: “Why Flash Drives Are Still Everywhere” by Paul Dourish

June 30, 2016


The flash drive exposes the great lie of technological progress, which is the idea that things are ever really left behind. It’s not just that an obsolete technology from the year of Saturday Night Fever still lurks unseen in the dank corners of a shiny new MacBook; it’s that it’s something that is relied upon regularly. The technology historian Thomas Hughes calls these types of devices “reverse salients”—those things that interrupt and disturb the forward movement of technology. They reveal the ugly truth that lies behind each slick new presentation from Google, Apple, or Microsoft: Technical systems are cobbled together from left-over pieces, digital Frankenstein’s monsters in which spare parts and leftovers are awkwardly sutured together and pressed into service. It turns out that the emblems of the technological future are much more awkwardly bound to the past than it’s comfortable to admit.

June 29, 2016


An expression of concern about the algorithms that shape what Americans read before they vote.
