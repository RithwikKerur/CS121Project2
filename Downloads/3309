    				Obama appoints Sonal Shah    			


Obama administration has included 4 Indians in his transition team.  Now he appointed Sonal Shah to co-chair the Technology, Innovation and Government Reform panel along with Julius Genachowski and
Blair Levin.  Sonal Shah heads Google.Org, the philanthropic arm of Google.  Surprisingly, some leftist groups are opposed to her appointment because of her family’s ties in India to RSS and VHP.
The speed at which Obama is building his team is impressive and he seems to be bringing people from various backgrounds.  In the current terrible and depressing financial climate, Obama has become the beacon of optimism for global recovery and progress.
