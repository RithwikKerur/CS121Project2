    				To Brazil — thinking Computer Vision in Developing Countries    			


I am leaving for Brazil — will be giving the first talk at a workshop on Computer Vision in Developing Countries.Â  Computer vision can play a very central role inÂ developing next generation computing that will extend benefits of computing and communications to the whole world.Â  Vision is our most powerful sense and we have not used it as much in main stream computing as it could be.Â  It is very exciting to start thinking about vision playing central role in the next phase — but we have to remember that for vision to play the central role it much work with other senses and other information sources.Â  The current dominant tendency to use exclusively vision needs to change.Â  This is what I will be thinking and presenting.Â  Will share my presentation when ready.Â
