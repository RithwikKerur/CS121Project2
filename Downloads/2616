    				Blinkx has better interface    			


I like the new interface that www.blinkx.tv has.  This interface still has a search box, but also displays lots of micons (moving icons used to display video) for showing many videos on its site.  It also aggregates important news items and lists them.  This look gives it more a feel of a visual portal bringing you video News than a video search engine.
Keyword box is important and useful, but search sites have to go beyond that, particularly those dealing with multimedia data.  This is a nice change in a leading video search site.
