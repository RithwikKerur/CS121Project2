    				Product company in Nagpur    			


A product company in the space of mobile games is going to be launced soon in Nagpur.  This company already has some products and will start operations aggressively soon.  It has a portfolio of products including Location Based Services products.
It is nice to be involved in helping start of a product company in Nagpur.  It has been great to help Lambent become a prominent company in Nagpur and it will certainly be very rewarding to help a product company  take shape here.
