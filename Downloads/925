"Lectures were once useful, but now when all can read,
and books are so numerous, lectures are unnecessary." 
-- Samuel Johnson, 1709-1784

The course textbook will be Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,
Fourth Edition, by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.

Interests
Artificial Intelligence

My dissertation and subsequent research focused on automated reasoning and
machine learning.


University Computer Science Education

At UC Irvine I taught Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering,
Social Impacts of Computerization, Computer Graphics, and
Introductory Programming.



In 2001, 2002, and 2012 I was voted the "Outstanding Professor" by the
graduating seniors in ICS.


K-12 Computer Science Education

I co-wrote 
the
K-12 Computer Science Framework.



I chaired the Computer Science Teachers Association committee that wrote

A Model Curriculum for K-12 Computer Science: Level I Objectives and Outlines.


I was Principal Investigator on a $600,000
National Science Foundation grant
that brought computer science, game design, and cultural education to
American Indian high school students, who
created games that retold traditional stories and cultural practices.


My 1997 paper
Fourth Grade Computer Science
has been credited with making a significant contribution to the recent upswing in
computer science education at the primary and secondary levels.


Video Game Design and Programming

I cofounded UC Irvine's

major in Computer Game Science, and for several years was
chair of the CGS Steering Committee.



I taught courses in Game Design, Game Engines, and Games and Society.
