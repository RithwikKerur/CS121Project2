    				Indian Sentiments (in Cricket)    			


It was very interesting to read Dileep Premchandran write on a situation in Indian Cricket:
Eventually, the need to move on and forge a new direction for Indian cricket lost out to that great enemy of excellence: sentiment.  Having stripped Sourav Ganguly of the Test captaincy and given it to the man best equipped to lead India, the five wise men couldn’t find the strength to go the distance. 
This characterizes not only Cricket but many other things in life from politics to family decisions.  Even important business decisions face the same fate.  Being an Indian, many times I feel that this may be one of the biggest hurdle that India faces in its search for excellence.
