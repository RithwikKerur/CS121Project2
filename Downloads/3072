    				User Generated Stock Photos    			


With user generated content coming everywhere, why not stock photos.Â  In a story at News.com Stephan Shankland reports:
The site, called SnapVillage, differs from several of its rivals by letting photographers set their own prices from a range of options: $1, $5, $10, $25 or $50. The company hopes that choice, along with flexible but easy search tools, will encourage photographers to contribute and customers, such as ad agencies, to buy.

Thanks for this interesting Share! If I’m not mistaken there is another website which allows photographers to set their own price as well. It also has bidding option too. However I can’t remember the site’s url.
