UC IT Blog: “Telepresence Learning with Robots at UC Irvine” (Judy Olson quoted)

August 9, 2018


Being a student is tough. On top of trying to succeed academically, one has to navigate the social aspect of making friends, interacting with others, and figuring out one’s identity. Now, imagine doing all that while being homebound. UC Irvine Informatics Professor Emeritus Judy Olson and NIH-funded Postdoctoral Fellow Veronica Newhart can help. They use groundbreaking technology – telepresence robots – to help students with chronic illnesses go from homebound to school bound.

University of Wisconsin-Madison: “A video game can change the brain, may improve empathy in middle schoolers” (Constance Steinkuehler and Kurt Squire mentioned)




A space-exploring robot crashes on a distant planet. In order to gather the pieces of its damaged spaceship, it needs to build emotional rapport with the local alien inhabitants. The aliens speak a different language but their facial expressions are remarkably humanlike.
This fantastical scenario is the premise of a video game developed for middle schoolers by University of Wisconsin–Madison researchers to study whether video games can boost kids’ empathy, and to understand how learning such skills can change neural connections in the brain.

Nardi’s Paper on Instant Messaging Receives Lasting Impact Award




Since 2014, the Lasting Impact Award has been awarded annually at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW). It recognizes a paper published at the CSCW conference at least 10 years prior that has been extremely influential. This year’s award goes to “Interaction and Outeraction: Instant Messaging in Action,” a paper written in 2000 by Informatics Professor Bonnie Nardi, UC Santa Cruz Professor Steve Whittaker and former Informatics Ph.D. student Erin Bradner, now the director of robotics at Autodesk.

El Comercio: “I want Peru be a technological power” (Profile on Rosalva Gallardo, Ph.D. ’12)




An interview with Rosalva Gallardo, manager of privacy programs for the Google Cloud: In 1998, while studying engineering in Lima, Rosalva dreamed of working in Silicon Valley. In 2006, she got a scholarship that allowed her to earn a doctorate in California (at UCI), which led to her working at Intel before being hired last year by Google.

Discover: “Connected Learning Summit” (Constance Steinkuehler mentioned)

August 8, 2018


Nonetheless, despite all the different paths, the conference felt like one community, something conference organizer Constance Steinkuehler, professor of education and game-based learning at the University of California–Irvine, emphasized on a panel. She said the conference was about building relationships. … Another conference organizer, Kurt Squire, Professor at The University of California, Irvine, member of the Connected Learning Laboratory, commented that the conference was about people coming together on equal footing to solve problems.

Informatics Department Welcomes World-Renowned Scholar Marian Petre

August 7, 2018


The Informatics Department has just gained an important ally with Marian Petre, professor of computing at The Open University in the U.K., thanks to UCI’s Distinguished Visiting Professor Initiative. Petre is the perfect candidate for the initiative, which aims to “attract a cohort of high-impact scholars who are also inspirational leaders and educators to the campus for one in-residence quarter per year for up to five years.”

Forbes: “How SMEs Can Catch The AI Wave” (Gloria Mark mentioned)




According to an interview with Gloria Mark, a department of informatics professor at the University of California, Irvine, which was published by Fast Company, her research has found that each interruption can set back a worker for up to 20 minutes. Considering that employees are interrupted every three minutes, on average, it becomes clear how this seemingly innocuous occurrence can eat away at your productivity and efficiency levels.

Daily Bruin: “Comic-Con panel discusses Afrofuturism in ‘Black Panther,’ Octavia Butler’s works” (Roderic Crooks mentioned)

July 27, 2018


Five months after its release, scholars are still meticulously dissecting Ryan Coogler’s film in the hopes of gaining a thorough understanding of its impact on the black community. The 2018 San Diego Comic Convention panel “Beyond Wakanda: Intersectional Afrofuturism” analyzed “Black Panther” as well as the literary works of Octavia Butler, a black feminist and science fiction author, through the lens of Afrofuturism while encouraging audience engagement. Afrofuturism is a black aesthetic, philosophical and artistic movement that dates back to the mid-20th century, said panelist Dalena Hunter, an archivist and librarian at the UCLA Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies. Among other panelists discussing the movement were Shani Miller and Kelly Besser, UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive and Library Special Collections archivists, respectively, as well as UC Irvine assistant professor Roderic Crooks.

Wired: “Google Glass is back–now with artificial intelligence” (Gillian Hayes quoted)

July 25, 2018


Gillian Hayes, a professor who works on human-computer interaction at University of California Irvine, says the Plataine project and plugging Google’s AI services into Glass play to the strengths of the controversial hardware. … “Image and voice recognition technology getting better will make wearable devices more functional,” Hayes says.

Bustle: “Why The Best Video Games Are The Ones That Make Men Cry” (Bonnie Ruberg quoted)

July 24, 2018


While Gone Home isn’t a new game (it debuted in 2013), it has set a new standard for role playing video games where the player embodies someone going through a realistic life experience. ….”You can still make choices you feel good about or feel bad about. There’s almost a moral component,” says Bonnie Ruberg, professor of informatics at University of California, Irvine and a scholar of queer video games.
