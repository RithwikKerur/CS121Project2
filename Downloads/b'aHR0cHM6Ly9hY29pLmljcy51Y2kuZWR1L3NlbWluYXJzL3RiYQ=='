Abstract: The fundamental problem of managing an inventory over time in the presence of stochastic demand is one of the core problems of Operations Research, and related models have been studied since late 19th century. A central model in inventory theory, where demand that cannot immediately be met is lost, was first introduced in 1958 by Karlin and Scarf. It is well known that such lost-sales inventory models with lead times are notoriously difficult to optimize due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent numerical experiments have suggested that a so-called capped base-stock policy demonstrates superior performance compared with existing heuristics. However, the superior performance lacks of a theoretical foundation and why such a policy performs so well in general remains a major open question. In this talk, we provide a theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. In a continuous review lost-sales inventory model with lead times and Poisson demand, we prove that this policy has a worst-case performance guarantee of 1.79 by conducting an asymptotic analysis under large penalty cost and lead time following Reiman (2004). This result provides a deeper understanding of the superior numerical performance of capped base-stock policies, and lays the foundations for a new approach to proving worst-case performance guarantees of simple policies in notoriously hard inventory problems.
