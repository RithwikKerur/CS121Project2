Mock Interview

On April 15, WICS collaborated with UCI’s Career Center to bring its members a day of mock interviews. Partnering with companies like Laserfiche and Blizzard, many WICS members experienced what it is like to be interviewed by actual companies and gained valuable experience that will help them prepare for real-life interviews in the future.
