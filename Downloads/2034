  Academic Integrity 
 All students are expected to be familiar with the class policies below. Failure to adhere to these
 policies may result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class. 
 


  It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with 
UCI's Academic Integrity Policies
and
 UCI's definitions and examples of
academic misconduct.
 For individual assignments

 All problem solutions and code that you submit must be material you have personally written during 
this quarter, except for any standard publicly-available library or utility functions.  
 you can discuss the assignments verbally  with other class members. However, you cannot look at written material related to homework solutions: you are not allowed to look at any written material related to assignment solutions (notes, written solutions, etc) or to copy anyone else's written solutions or code.

  For team projects

 All the text and figures in your reports  must be written by you or members of your project team. If you wish to quote text or use figures from another source you need to clearly indicate this by putting the cited text in  quotation marks or in italic font and by providing a citation to the orginal source. 
 
The code that you use for your class projects will be a combination of code written by you and your team members and publicly-available library code. You should clearly indicate in your reports and in your
code documentation which parts of your code was written by you or your team
and which parts of your code were imported from somewhere else.
