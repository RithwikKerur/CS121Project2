    				Seraja Update 061115    			


I am happy that a new beta version of Seraja is up and running.Â  This version has entirely different experience pages, has much better interfaces to add events and enter all information related to it, has powerful environment to create and use groups for events that you may want to share only with a group of people.Â  Many more interesting features are coming.Â  Now Seraja is ready for people to share events and experiences with their family, friends, and everybody.Â  Try this beta version at
www.seraja.com
and tell me how you like it.Â  More on it later.
