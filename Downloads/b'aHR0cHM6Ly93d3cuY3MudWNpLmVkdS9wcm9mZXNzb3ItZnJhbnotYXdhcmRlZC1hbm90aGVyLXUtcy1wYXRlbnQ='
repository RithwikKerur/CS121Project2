Professor Franz awarded another U.S. Patent
November 1, 2019 
Chancellor’s Professor Michael Franz and two of his former Post-Doctoral researchers were awarded a fundamental United States Patent (No. 10,430,265) that makes software diversity viable as a cyber-defensive technology. As the patent explains:
“Error report reporting errors that occur during software execution may be normalized to account for diversification of single software program. A method for useful providing error reports comprises receiving information regarding computer system status at a time of failure of proper execution of a diversified implementation of a computer program, the computer program having a plurality of diversified implementations; and transforming the information regarding the computer system status using metadata indicative of differences between the diversified implementation of the computer program and a canonical implementation of the computer program.”
Congratulations to Professor Franz and his co-authors.
