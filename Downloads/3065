    				Camera with WiFi    			


It had to happen — News.com reports that there are soon going to be memory cards with WiFi connectivity to upload your photos to a site or your computer directly from your camera using this memory card.Â  This will definitely make it easy to upload images.Â 
Â 
Now what do I do with all those images that will be uploaded?Â  How can I organize and access them or will they be just becoming part of my collection that I will rarely visit?Â  Time for researchers to take real photo management seriously.
