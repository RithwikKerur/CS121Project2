Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Toolbox for Matlab
Kernel density estimation and many related problems
KD-tree data structures for fast spatial computations
Includes products of Gaussian mixtures, for NBP
 

Nonparametric Belief Propagation
Example NBP Code by Danny Bickson
Uses KDE Toolbox; sample applications from low-density lattice decoding (LDLC), multiuser detection, fault identification and compressive sensing.
 

Adaptive Inference in Factor Trees, for Matlab
Efficient incorporation of model changes into a tree-structured factor graph
Model updates take O(log n) time each
Query marginal distributions in O(log n) time; maintain MAP configurations in O(d log n/d) time, where d is the number of changes in the configuration. 
 

Markov-modulated Poisson processes for event detection in count data
Mote count sensors
 

Gaussian Process Regression with uncertain time-shifts, used for gene expression time series.
Uses Gaussian process regression to estimate the profile of each gene, while allowing each replicate organism to
shift slightly in time relative to the others, to account for biological variation in development speed.
