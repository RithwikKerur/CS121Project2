Winter 2021 Week 4: Lean In Session 

 02/19/2021admin



This Monday, January 25, 2021, WICS held a Lean In Session to garner confidence and provide a supportive environment for members! Members were grouped into circles, where they stayed with the same people for each round. For the four rounds, they touched upon inspirations, confidence, gratitude, and reflection. Between the sessions, WICS gauged how everyone was feeling through a word cloud, which were all positive and uplifting!
