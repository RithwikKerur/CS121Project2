    				Busy but exciting time in Singapore.    			


I arrived in Singapore on Jan 3rd and became very busy.Â  MDA, an organization with excellent funding to make SingaporeÂ the media hub at the World level, Â is very interested in EventWeb and wants to use Seraja technology to show how events could be brought to people.Â  They have a big event MDA Jamboree on January 10 and want to show off things using Seraja.Â  We are planning to do a conference and lots of events using Seraja system to bring different type of events to show Interactive City like applications.Â  Since there is very little time, I got very busy with this.Â  Good thing is that this is resulting in good progress.
