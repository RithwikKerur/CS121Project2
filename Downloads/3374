    				Ideological Search    			


Yahoo reports beginning of a new search direction — ideological search.
In this approach, you can select your ideology and then the system will present results that you want to see — will not show any results that will offend you.  Interesting direction.  Some people may like it a lot.  For me, I want to get facts then decide what I want to do with those — rather than somebody filtering facts for me.  But then, thats me — and I am well aware that all of us are different.
