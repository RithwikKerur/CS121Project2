    				photojournalism    			


Danit Lidor writes  in an article in Forbes 
A picture may be worth a thousand words, but some enterprising people are hoping some pictures may also be worth a thousand dollars. 
…
Still, it remains to be seen if businesses that rely on coincidental or specialized access to images can be profitable. Tom Quinn is convinced the industry has legs. In fact, he says heâ€™s invested millions of his own cash to realize it. 
â€œThere are paradigm shifts going on in the news industry,â€? he says. â€œThe old [agent] infrastructure isnâ€™t viable. And thatâ€™s going to [tick] off a lot of companies.â€? 
It appears to me that this is just a beginning of changes not only in journalism, but also how we store and share our experiences.  It is definitely much easier to snap a picture and maybe add speech annotations to it rather than writing a note about it.  More importantly, in many, if not the most, cases it is also more expressive.
