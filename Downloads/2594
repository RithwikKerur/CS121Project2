    				Presentation on Observation Systems    			


I attended a meeting to review a program under VACE-2 by ARDA.  This program is related to developing Video Surveillance Systems using GRV (Ground Reconnaisance Video) data.  Our team consists of Northrop Grummans, U of Central Florida, and I.  My role is basically advisory role and I am helping NG team in their architecture design.  I presented my ideas related to Observation System as a genral class of system that has video surveillance as one of the examples.  I expressed some of my ideas about these system here.  More of my thoughts on observation systems will appear here soon in the form of white papers and technical ideas.
If interested you can access my presentation here.
