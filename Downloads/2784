    				SEraja .9 goes live    			


SEraja 0.9 has gone live.  This version is changed significantly from its original alpha (was called 0.8).  After limited testing by several invite people this will be further modified and then SEraja beta will be launched.  The plans are to launch it in April.  In the initial version of the EventWeb created by SEraja, most events will be from Bangalore reflecting the origin of the company.  Of course users can enter any events from any place so soon events from all over will start appearing on the EventWeb.
I am going to be in Banglore for 3 days earlynext week and then in Germany for a conference.  And then will come a trip to attend ICDE.  So next two weeks will be lots of travel.
