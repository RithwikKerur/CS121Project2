Michael T. Goodrich



Distinguished Professor
Dept. of Computer Science
Bren School of Info.
and Computer Sciences
University of California, Irvine




Short Biography


Prof. Goodrich received his B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science
from 
Calvin University in 1983 and his PhD in 
Computer Science
from 
Purdue University in 1987. 

He is a 

Distinguished Professor at the 
University of California, Irvine, 
where he has been a faculty member in the Department of
Computer Science since 2001.
In addition, he currently serves as
Technical Director for the ICS 
Center for Algorithms 
and Theory of Computation. 
He was a professor in the Department of
Computer Science at 
Johns Hopkins University from 1987-2001.

Dr. Goodrich's research is directed at the design of high
performance algorithms and data structures with applications
to information assurance and security, 
the Internet, 
machine learning,
and geometric computing.
He has pioneered and led research on efficient 
solutions to a number
of fundamental problems, including sorting, convex hull construction,
nearest-neighbor searching,
linear programming, privacy-preserving data access, network traceback,
and data authentication.
His
research has been supported by the U.S. 
National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
U.S. Department of Defense, including the Army Research Office (ARO),
the National Security Agency (NSA),
the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DAPRA)


With over 350 publications, including several widely-adopted
books, 
his recent work includes contributions to efficient and secure 
distributed data structures, 
information privacy,
social networks, 
and cloud security.
He has served as a scientific consultant to AT&T, 
Walt Disney Animation Studios, and
the National Science Foundation. He has
experience as an expert witness in patent and intellectual
property litigation
involving algorithms, cryptography, 
computer security, 
digital rights management (DRM), 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
machine learning, 
networking, software, 
hospitality industry technology,
printing/typesetting technology,
audio/video processing,
and storage technologies.
He is an 
ACM 
Distinguished Scientist, 
a 
Fellow of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 
a Fulbright Scholar (with senior specialist service in Denmark), 
a
Fellow of the IEEE,
and a 
Fellow 
of the ACM.
He is a recipient of the
IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Achievement Award,
the Brown Univ. Award for Technological Innovation,
and the Pond Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.
Recently, he was
elected as a 

foreign member of the 

Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.


His 
Erd≈ës number
is three (3), here's why.
