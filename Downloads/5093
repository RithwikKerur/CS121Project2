Spring 2022 Week 4: Mentorship LinkedIn Workshop 

 05/01/2022admin



On Friday, April 22 2022, of Week 4, WICS held the first mentorship event for spring quarter. Mentors and Mentees met up in DBH 6011 and got some great tips and advice on how to enhance and improve on LinkedIn profiles. Mentorship families were grouped to sit together where mentors looked over mentees’ profiles and provided some ways to make mentees’ profiles stand out from the rest. The event ended successfully with mentees and mentors bonding while gaining great advice!
