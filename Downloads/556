	ICSE 2014 – Software Design and Collaboration Laboratory





































SDCL Software Design and Collaboration Laboratory






Jun13

ICSE 2014 




Two members of SDCL – André and Thomas – attended ICSE 2014 in Hyderabad, India. André served as a Program Chair of ICSE, helping to select the program of ICSE. Thomas served as an organizer of a new workshop on Crowdsourcing in Software Engineering (CSI-SE). Both ICSE and CSI-SE went very well, and we had many great conversations with our colleagues.
Bonus: in the tradition of Where’s Waldo, where’s André? (hint: André is Dutch).
