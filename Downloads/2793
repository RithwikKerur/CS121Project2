    				eScience    			


At ICDE conference today, the keynote talk was by Tone Hey of Microsoft.  Ge talked about the emerging nature of science — eSciece.  Basically, eScience is the infrastructure to enable collaborative science.  He made an interesting argument that science evolved from experimental to theoretical to computational and now data centric eScience.
I participated in a panel on ‘Business Intelligence for Real Time Enterprise”.  Interesting that people want to deal with real time issues in spation temporal space and still want to use data engineering techniques that were developed for persistent data.  Set theory based entity oriented techniques are very gfood for dealing with persistent data, but are not going to help us with dynamic systems and their real time problems.
