Overview
This code implements a Markov-modulated Poisson process model for learning patterns of periodic activity in count-based sensors, and detecting aperiodic events (deviations from the normal pattern).

We use a discrete-time model, in which the data are modeled as consisting of the superposition of "normal" behavior, represented using a Poisson process, and "event" behavior consisting of increases (or more rarely, decreases) in the number of counts observed. The event behavior is captured using a Markov chain model to capture the idea of event persistence, allowing the model to find slight but sustained changes in activity and more accurately estimate the duration of a detected event. An example is shown at right, where the blue curve shows the observed counts, black the estimated normal profile; red bars show the estimated probability of an event at each time, and the bottom-most panel shows a partial ground truth of known events, held out from the model for validation purposes.

Data
Data used in our experiments are available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
Building -- in and out flow counts for the main entrance to a campus building
Freeway -- vehicle counts for a Los Angeles area freeway entrance
Code
KDD-06 -- Positive events only
