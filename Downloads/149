Opportunities for ICS Students
As members of the UCI community, all ICS students have access to a wide range of campus resources (a partial list of which can be viewed here). In addition to these, there are also opportunities for engagement and enrichment geared specifically towards ICS students.
ICS students are encouraged to complement their academics with extra-curricular activities such as research or joining a student organization.  Benefits of this include, but are not limited to: networking with other students, faculty and companies; participating in social activities; forming study groups and friendships; attending various workshops and presentations; gaining deeper experience and knowledge of your chosen field; and more.
