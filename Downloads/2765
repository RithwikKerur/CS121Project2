    				Future Surveillance    			


Stuart Ross pointed me to an article in National Geographic that paints a picture of next generation surveillance systems using audio and video.  It points out how emerging technology could do more effective surveillance using audio and dideo analysis techniques that are already being developed ‚Äî of course it takes long time from inception in advanced labs to practice.  A part that I liked is
Video and audio provide some data that can‚Äôt be gleaned from text-only communications or transcripts of conversations, Arizona‚Äôs Meservy said. 
For instance, numerous pauses or other ‚Äúdisfluencies‚Äù may indicate that a person is ‚Äúmanaging a greater cognitive load,‚Äù he said. The speaker could be halting because he or she is making up the story as he or she goes along. 
Good motivation to address new problems in audio and video analysis and a good lesson to video database systems that believe that speech and hence automatic speech recognition is sufficient to deal with video and audio.  Non verbal communication among humans is often more important than verbal ‚Äî we all know this instictively.  Don‚Äôt we?

i agree with ramesh, as i read how listening devices like the ones found here on http://www.audiointercept.com are used for audio surveillance only, while there may be body language involved that may not be visible to an audio surveillance recording. however, for law enforcement purposes, it may seem that what a person says is what it is, and that is a record of their speech.

Biometrics have been introduced in the New Zealand workplace with few legal problems. In one case, the New Zealand Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union complained to the Privacy Commissioner about a company‚Äôs introduction of finger scanning technology for time keeping.

With the way technology is advancing i think by the end of this comment new ways of harnessing the audio video for surveillance would be found.  but before they really go further with new technologies, they should concentrate on effective technologies..

Good motivation, to solve new problems, audio and video analysis and a good lesson to the video database system, so that the speech and automatic speech recognition is enough to handle video and audio. Non-human verbal communication is often important than words ‚Äì we all know this instictively. Is not it?I like the article very much,and I have read it for twice time ,then I can understand it.
