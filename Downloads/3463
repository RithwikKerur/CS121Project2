    				CK Prahalad: One more tribute    			


CK Prahalad was a remarkable person and his loss is felt by many.  He was a true friend — when he was your friend.  Lately he was a true friend of India.  His work about India is remarkable.  One of the best lectures by him was earlier this year as Palkhivala Lecture in which he articulated challenges faced by India in very constructive way.
A very good tribute to CK is written by Neelima Mahajan in Forbes India.  This article has a good coverage — except one minor misunderstanding resulting in a slightly wrong quote about returning wine — of my interactions and relationship with him.

I agree he’s a great person from what I have heard of people who had so much to say about his contributions.  Unfortunately, I have never met him.

I have been reading a lot about CK Prahalad lately.Thanks for providing the link of Neelima Mahajan.He has written some great books too.More importantly he was a progressive thinker.His death is a great loss to not only India but also the world as he was among the top ten management thinkers.Look forward to hearing from you soon again.Thanks.

His work with Hamel on marketing and strategy was groundbreaking and marks him out as one of the greats.
