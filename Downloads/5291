WICS Spring Quarter Week 4: Blind Squirrel Games Debugging Session 

 04/23/201805/01/2018admin



On April 23, 2018, WICS hosted a Debugging session with Blind Squirrel Games. First, we ate pizza and socialized with other members. Then software engineers from Blind Squirrel told us all the cool stuff they do that their company. They taught us that debugging is an important part of their workday. After, the engineers talked about the basics of debugging. Their in-depth presentation showed us different ways to debug code, an important skill that is super useful to know in class as well as the workplace. Attendees left with a better understanding of how to debug code!
