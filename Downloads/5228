Winter 2021 Week 6: Hack x WICS Resume Workshop (ft. a recruiter from GUESS) 

 02/20/202104/23/2021admin



On Monday, February 8, 2021, WICS collaborated with Hack at UCI to host a Resume Workshop. This workshop featured a special guest, Isadora Ocampo, who is a recruiter at GUESS. Isadora walked through a detailed presentation of resume best practices and advice on how to pass the initial resume screen. She emphasized the importance of keeping a resume clean, concise, and consistent. A recruiter only looks at a resume for about seven seconds! In addition to resume tips, she highlighted the importance of LinkedIn and networking. Having the perfect resume isn’t enough — you must form connections in the industry you want to be in. Isadora was a great guest and we’d be more than happy to have her back!
