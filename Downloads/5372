WICS Fall Quarter Week 8: Movie Night 

 11/22/201912/01/2019admin



On Monday, November 20th, WICS hosted a movie night social where over 25 people attended. The event started off with some socializing where all the attendees settled in and just talked to one another while the movie was being set up. Once everyone got their pizza and popcorn, the movie was started. We watched the 2013 movie, Monsters University. All the students found the event to be quite relaxing because it was during peak midterm season and everyone needed a break!
