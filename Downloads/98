Informatics. It’s the field you’ve never heard of, and the one you know everything about. In a digital age, technology — how we design it, how we use it and how it affects us — touches all aspects of our lives. It shapes the way we live, the way we work and the way we build the foundations of a global society. Informatics is a window into this dynamic relationship, examining the interplay of people and technology and what it means for our collective future.
