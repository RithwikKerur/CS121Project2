The Future of Conferences: Crista Lopes Considers Sustainability and Inclusivity

November 9, 2021




When Crista Lopes was asked to give a keynote talk at Strange Loop 2021, the Informatics Professor from UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) wasn’t sure what she wanted to discuss. She considered the fact that Strange Loop brings together developers and scholars building tomorrow’s technology — that is, people typically interested in highly technical topics — but she eventually decided she “couldn’t do the happy techie talk.” Instead, she gave a keynote on The Future of Conferences, examining the origins, value and costs of conferences; reviewing the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic; and considering what post-pandemic conferences might look like.

Paul Dourish Wins Lasting Impact Award for Rethinking Interaction Design

November 7, 2021



In October, at the 24th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 21), the Lasting Impact Award went to the 1996 paper “Re-place-ing Space: The Roles of Place and Space in Collaborative Systems,” by Steve Harrison and Paul Dourish. This is not the first time this award, which recognizes a paper that is at least 10 years old and has had an impact on the CSCW field, has been awarded to Dourish, Chancellor’s Professor and Steckler Endowed Chair of Informatics in UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). He also won the award five years ago for a 1992 paper with Victoria Bellotti, “Awareness and Coordination in Shared Workspaces.” Dourish’s impact continues with this 1996 work focused on early experiments in video-mediated communication.

Student Spotlight: U.S. Marine Corps Put Cheonwoo Seo on Path to Business Information Management at UCI

November 1, 2021



Originally from Seoul, South Korea, Cheonwoo Seo moved to Orange County in September 2010. After graduating from high school in 2014, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a data systems administrator for four years before earning his associate degree in business administration and economics from Cypress Community College. The newly transferred junior chose to continue his studies at UCI because of the breadth of degrees offered in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). After exploring his options, he settled on business information management (BIM) in the Department of Informatics. “I like to invent new techniques, so even if I do the same jobs and tasks every day, I can make it better and more fun,” he says. “My goal at UCI is to gain knowledge that strengthens my data systems background from the military so I can start my professional career.”
