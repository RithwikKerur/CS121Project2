Winter Quarter 2017 Week 2: Mock Technical Interviews Prep Workshop 

 01/18/201703/07/2017Diana Sandil



On the wonderful and chilly Wednesday of January 18, 2017, 60 students gathered together to learn about the joys and wonders of interview! WICS offered invaluable experience and tips for acing any interview. For Freshmen and Sophomores, student speakers spoke about their experiences in and how to land an amazing internship with companies that specifically target underclassmen. We also offered guidance for upperclassmen on how to prepare for their interviews, whether it be PM or Software Engineer! Students gained awesome skills that will help them in their next interview, or at least during WICS’s Mock Technical Interviews next week. We would like to thank everyone for coming enjoyed the advice/pizza! Go forth and interview!
