Hall of Fame
To honor those alumni who have made a significant impact in their profession or, in other ways, have brought distinction to the School, we created the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences Hall of Fame. To learn more about the Hall of Fame and its inductees, visit the ICS Hall of Fame website.

ICS Alumni Chapter
The ICS Alumni Chapter is re-launching and gearing up to be active in 2020. A new group has come together to create and share opportunities to reconnect, learn, and do some community outreach. Connect with us on social media and in-person to share stories, network, learn, think, and do fun things in the spirit of our alma mater and technology:

Chapter Website
Discord
Facebook Group
LinkedIn

Let’s connect, network, share knowledge and opportunities!
Also, if you would like to volunteer or get involved behind the scenes with the chapter with events, reach out to leadership@icsanteaters.org.

Class Notes & Staying Connected 
We're looking for your Class Notes! Whether you have a new job, started a new company or have any other exciting professional or personal news you want to share with other ICS alumni, we want to know. Please email your Class Notes to matt.miller@uci.edu so that we can consider them for the next ICS Annual Report, as well as on social media and our website. You can also make sure we have your most updated email and mailing addresses so you continue to receive information about ICS and our upcoming events, by sending your updated information to matt.miller@uci.edu.
