    				Interest in Nagpur    			


Many Nagpurians (or Nagpurkars) are getting serious about doing things in Nagpur to help the momentum to make it a great city in India.Â  One of them is a great friend, Dinesh Jain, who has formed a group called Nagpur-first to bring together people interested in Nagpur and doing things there.Â  You can contact him at: dinesh@aagami.net
Dinesh sent me a very nice presentation on Nagpur.Â  The presentation is here.
Â 
I have not been to Nagpur since January 2007, and will be there in December.Â  Looking forward to visit there and see things for myself.
