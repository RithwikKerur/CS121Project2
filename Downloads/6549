Course Outline








Course Outline
 
This is a lab based course. The goal of the
          course is to reinforce some of the networking concepts that
          were taught in a asic introductory networking course. The lab
          is structured around lab exercises that highlight topics such
          as IP addressing and forwarding, LAN switching, data link and
          ARP, routing (RIP, OSPF), TCP, ICMP, NAT, DHCP, etc. The
          course consists of a sequence of labs that build upon each
          other. Lab quizzes are used to evaluate the students’
          understanding of the material and ensure that students have
          completed the assigned lab exercises. All networking concepts
          that appear in the labs are covered weekly in class. A
          final written exam tests students on the concepts covered in
          class. 
 
Prerequisites:
          Introduction to Networking Course (a strict requirement!)
 
Class Notes: Available online on my website.

Software: Available via
        online public downloads.

Class Communication: Piazza
        Classroom - Students will be added to a classroom account.
        All  queries/questions related to labs and quizzes should
        be directed thru Piazza to the TA, Reader, myself and other
        students. Students are recommended highly to participate in the
        Piazza discussions. We will monitor activity and give credit
        (see grading below) to those that are vocal and have intelligent
        and coherent responses. Any fake or irresponsible participation
        will have a negative impact.
