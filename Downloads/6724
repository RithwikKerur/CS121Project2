Disclaimer: These are guidelines
            are intended to help students plan their work in this class.
            However, the instructor does reserve the right to make
            changes if needed, including students' signups.


General
          Educational Aims: This course provides an introduction to
        the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), with an emphasis
        on user interface design and evaluation. Students will learn
        methods for user needs and task analysis as well as interface
        testing, and guidelines for good user interface design.
Requirements:
        Graduate level. Students should have used computers and
        different software for at least one year☺.
       
Format:
        Lecture by instructor, quarter-long term project with internal and
        external clients, project presentations.
This
          class vs. INF232: This class will focus on practical HCI skills and
        training. It will cater to the needs of master students and of
        those PhD students who are mostly interested in the practical
        aspects of HCI. 
        The INF 232 class will instead cater to Ph.D. students who
        intend to focus on HCI as a research




          topic (MS students who are particularly qualified and
        theoretically inclined can also be admitted). It will focus on
        influential HCI literature, HCI theory, and current research
        questions. A familiarity with basic HCI topics and methods will
        be assumed.

        Lecture: MW
        2:00-3:20pm, MSTB 110.
        Starts on Oct. 2

The discussions are mostly for
        project meetings, sometimes with the customer. Register for one
        discussion/project only. The instructor reserves the right
        though to reassign students to ensure suitable head counts and
        skill sets.

    Discussion 1
            (code 37341): M 9-10:50am MSTB
              110 and F 9-10:50am DBH

Project 1: Facilitating job search with
        social support and gamification (Naomi Sugie, UCI, nsugie at
        uci.edu)
 This project aims for the
              design of a user interface for an application that assists
              released convicts in finding jobs. Special attention
              should be paid to the inclusion of real-time job
              information, peer-based social support, a GPS-based
              "check-in" function when at potential employers, and the
              integration of gamification elements to sustain user
              engagement over time.  Students should develop early
              designs for the different system components, solicit
              feedback from the target audience, and consider this
              feedback during the development of an interactive mockup.
              Students should decide whether a standalone Android app or
              a browser extension for Facebook is the better
              approach.  


    Discussion 2
            (code 37342): Tu 2-3:50pm MSTB
                110 and Th 2-3:50pm SSL152. Starts on Oct. 3

Project 2: Usability design for chatbot in a
            group collaboration scenario (Dakuo Wang, IBM Research, dakuow1 at
            uci.edu)

 The aim
                    of the project is to look into the usefulness of an
                    intelligent agent (chatbox) in a textual group
                    collaboration, with the aim of improving the
                    collaboration. The topic can be approached from
                    different perspectives, and it is up to the student
                    team to decide whether it is practical to achieve
                    any or all of these goals:


It has to start with an understanding
                        or exploration of what the needs are in a group
                        collaboration scenario. What kinds of
                        collaborative tasks the group might need a
                        chatbot's help, and how the chatbot can be
                        designed to help. Given this is a class, the
                        target user groups in this context could be
                        student teams. 
It can be from the system design
                        perspective. That the students from an
                        engineering background to actually build a
                        prototype using the existing programming
                        frameworks or AI libraries (e.g., IBM,
                        Microsoft, Google, or Facebook). In the target
                        use case, this prototype chatbot can respond to
                        or proactively intervene the group's
                        behavior.  
 It can be a Wizard of Oz study.
                        With a script, a student plays as the
                        chatbot/agent to interact or intervene a group's
                        behavior.
 The study design can be a
                        in-situ experiment or a lab experiment. 
 It can also consist with survey
                        or interview study.
