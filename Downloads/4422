About us 


Welcome to the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at UC Irvine. Research in the fields of machine learning and intelligent systems addresses the fundamental problem of developing computer algorithms that can harness the vast amounts of digital data available in the 21st century and then use this data in an intelligent way to solve a variety of real-world problems. Examples of research activities in the Center range across areas as different as web search engines, statistical text mining, spam email filtering, information retrieval, automated reasoning, image and video data analysis, sensor networks, astronomy and planetary sciences, ocean and atmospheric sciences, systems biology, medical diagnosis, chemical informatics, and microarray genomics.
Research projects in the Center use theories and techniques from the intersection of computer science, statistics, and mathematics, including foundational ideas from algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and databases (computer science), multivariate data analysis, Bayesian estimation, and computational statistics (from statistics), and optimization and probability theory (from mathematics). Research in the Center also has a very strong interdisciplinary component, including collaborations in areas ranging from sensors and ubiquitous computing, to databases and computer vision, to software engineering and Web applications. Projects involving collaborations with scientists are also numerous, including automated analysis of brain images, analysis of microarray gene expression data with microarrays, tracking storms in satellite data of the Earth’s oceans, and many more.
We hope you find the Center’s web site useful and encourage you to explore its contents.
