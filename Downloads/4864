Winter Quarter 2017 Week 5: Twilio Info Session 

 02/08/201703/07/2017Diana Sandil



On Wednesday February 8th, WICS teamed up with ICS Student Council to host an inspiring information session with Twilio! We had a great turnout of 58 participants ready and excited to learn. Twilio demonstrated their awesome API and sent out text notifications to our audience. We learned through the Q&A time that Twilio is an engaging and welcoming company where their interns can work on real projects. Twilio will be back on campus in October 2017 to recruit for summer 2018 internships. As a closing statement our Twilio representatives encourage us to “Be open to learn. In a small company like Twillio, you’ll make a big impact.” So keep an eye out for when applications open up again and apply!
