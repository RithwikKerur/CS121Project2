Labs »



 The ICS Labs are located in the Computer Science Building. Students
          enrolled in ICS classes can obtain computing accounts for use in the
          labs. Here, students can put into action what they've learned in their
          lectures. 
There are four labs with over two hundread machines, running Windows
          and Linux. Scheduled labs for classes are held in the first floor labs:
          CS183, CS189, and CS192. The main lab is located in CS364 and it is
          the only ICS Lab that is opened on the weekend. Please see the Lab
          Hours page for details on hours of operation.
