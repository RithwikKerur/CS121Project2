Social

Our group works together to approach major social topics - such as environmental issues, education, and politics - through technological innovation, analysis, and understanding.





Code
 
                    We are interested in software, hardware, and various combinations thereof that bring people together
                     to engender novel forms of social interaction and possibly enact social change.
                 




Group
                    We believe in bringing people and technologies together in novel and engaging ways.  
                    The Social Code Group explores issues involved in creating interactive technology for a variety of audiences, from children to gamers to IT professionals.
