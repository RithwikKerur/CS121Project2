WICS WINTER QUARTER WEEK 8: AMAZON INTERVIEW WORKSHOP 

 02/26/2018admin



On Monday, February 26th, 2018, WICS held an interview workshop with Amazon in DBH 6011. This event had more than 100 RSVPs and approximately 80 showed up in the event. The first half of the event was a presentation presented by Angela who is currently a software engineer at Amazon. The presentation included tips on resume, career fair, and interview. Angela also talked about two types of questions recruiters usually ask on interviews which are technical questions and behavioral questions. The presentation ended with a Q&A session for students with all the recruiters who came along with Angela. The second half of this event was led by Kevin, an interviewer from Amazon. Kevin simulated a mock tech interview with a student volunteer in the front. After discussing the tech interview question with Kevin, we took a pizza break. After the break, we did more tech interview questions with the recruiters. This event started at 6 pm and ended at 8:07 pm. We could see that everyone was curious and eager to learn from the recruiters. Overall, This event was a success!
