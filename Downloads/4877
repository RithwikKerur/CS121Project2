Fall Quarter 2016 Week 2: Social Meet and Greet Event 

 10/05/201611/06/2016Diana Sandil



On the 5th of October, WICS held a social event where anyone could come socialize and meet the WICS Board members for this school year! There were about 29 attendees who came to our event, which was located in Aldrich Park. Underclassman and new transfer students were able to ask questions about what WICS is like, how to get more involved, how are the courses for being an ICS major, and so on. Everyone participated in a social activity which involved remembering the person on your left and right names. There were also a couple of students who were playing catch with a frisbee! If you missed out on this event hopefully you can go to the next one and thanks for coming by!
