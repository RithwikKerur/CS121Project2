Informatics 41 Videos






INFORMATICS 41 • DAVID G. KAY • UC IRVINE 
 Video Lectures 

Below are links to six short video lectures that provide more background on some topics we touched on in class.
Everyone is expected to watch these videos; the major points may show up on quizzes (starting with the second quiz on October 4). And don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions on any of these topics in class.
At present, these videos download to your computer, which may take a little while. Apparently our servers don't support streaming.
