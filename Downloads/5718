Lecture 18--Online
U (NY Times Magazine, 19 Nov 00)
A. Background
Trying to keep a faculty member
at Williams
Global Education Network (GEN)
for profit
4-5 courses by February
25 courses by September
$20 million and probably more
"Dancing with the devil: information
technology
and the new competition in higher education"
James Duderstadt
B. A sample course--Introduction to biology
for non-majors
CD
Interaction--1 facilitator for 30 students
C. The big picture
 
In the beginning, GEN anticipates
that 90% of its customers
will be adult learners taking courses
on a not for credit basis.
The other 10% will be advanced placement
high school students.
The elite colleges and universities will
be
producers of material, not consumers
 
On the internet now are courses
catering to
alumni,
extension students,
continuing education,
professional education, e.g.,
Concord Law School has an
enrollment
of 500 students in a four year JD
program at a cost of $20K advertising that it will take 2.5 hours/day of
student time
Unext.com
Gary Becker, B. Rosenfield
on-line business courses to big companies
Columbia, Chicago, Stanford, CMU,
LSE
Second best
Degree program


Arguments similar to Brown
and Duguid
25 courses represent 50% of enrollments
Break up universities into constituent
parts
D. Players
Mark Taylor--Williams faculty
J. Derrida --was
a "mentor" of  Taylor--another UCI connection
Herb Allen --entrepreneur
E. Let's make a deal
GEN will take risk, you provide
material, students
Who signs up? Duke, Brown, Wellesley
Who doesn't?--Harvard, Williams
Williams--customers not there, profits
not there
Can GEN sign up Harvard professors?

Turning to online
schools for advanced degrees,
Ligos, M, NY Times, 19 Nov 00, BU 10
"In the past few years, hundreds of
traditional universities
and private, for-profit institutions
have begun offering
on-line advanced courses or graduate
programs, including MBA's and law degrees, so busy professional can take
courses on their own time, on their own laptop computers--often at a lower
cost than a traditional graduate degree. About a third of all colleges
and universities in the United States have some level of distance learning,
as it is called, and an estimated 1.6 million students are enrolled in
those programs. Many companies provide tuition reimbursements."
Issues--lack of interaction, accreditation,
counseling, faculty, class size,
synchronous, cost
