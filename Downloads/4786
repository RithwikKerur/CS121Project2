        leveraging in-situ and mobile Internet of Things (IoT) devices to build resilient and secure edge computing and data processing architectures for Cyber-Physical Systems.    





I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D student at the University of California, Irvine. I am currently part of the Distributed Systems Middleware group working with Prof. Nalini Venkatasubramanian. My research interests include Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, Data Exchange and Management, Resilient Middleware, and Cyber-Physical Systems. Prior to joining UCI, I worked with Dr. Maitreya Natu and Dr. Vaishali Sadaphal at Tata Research Development and Design Centre, Pune, India.
