Tenth Homework






ICS H21 • UC IRVINE • DAVID G. KAY • FALL 2009 
Tenth Homework 
There's nothing to turn in for this homework, but try to complete it by 
  Monday, November 30. 

(1) Read the epilogue of the book,
  starting on page 677.  On line, if you take the "next" link past
  the end of Chapter 43, you'll get there (even though it doesn't
seem to appear in the on-line list of contents). 
(2) Read over Lab Assignment 9 so you're ready to go on Monday. In particular, work through part (b.1).


Based in part on ICS H21assignments by David
G. Kay from Fall 2003; modified by David G. Kay, Fall 2004, Fall 2005, Fall 2008, Fall 2009.
