New Report Finds Tech Inequality Persists, Proposes Solutions

October 31, 2017


Free and open technologies do not democratize education, but strategies to combat educational inequity exist and should be replicated, a new report by digital learning experts recommends.
The report —“From Good Intentions to Real Outcomes: Equity by Design in Learning Technologies” — published today proposes following promising strategies the authors found that are addressing equity in learning technologies. New technologies, even free ones, they argue, disproportionately benefit students with the financial, social, and technical capital to take advantage of them.

WalletHub: “2017’s States Most Vulnerable to Identity Theft & Fraud” (Dourish quoted)

October 18, 2017


Information online, of course, does have a major role to play, especially in light of incidents like that with Equifax. The spread of social media does factor into this in a number of ways. One is obviously the fact that we all have more and more information online, but another is that, even if the accounts don’t have access to sensitive information, each social media account is a potential source of weakness for the security of your information, especially when it can potentially be used to impersonate you and gain access to other information held at other sites. This is also why it’s important to use unique passwords for each site, so that if your password is compromised, you can limit the damage.
