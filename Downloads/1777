CS274b: Ideas for Projects


Here are collected some possible project ideas and associated papers.  You do not need to choose something on this list; it is just a list of possibilities to get you started.  You may structure your project exploration around a general problem type, algorithm, or data set, but should explore around your problem, testing thoroughly or comparing to alternatives.

You should submit a project proposal (1 page description of your group and proposed project concept) by Friday 4/22.

You should turn in a write-up (< 10 pages) describing your project and its outcomes, similar to a research-level publication (journal or CS conference); I suggest the latex styles for NIPS or UAI. This is due by 5pm Friday 6/3, to EEE.


Inference projectsExplore a particular inference algorithm's performance, either for inference itself or when used as part of learning.  
Variational techniques

Monte Carlo techniques

Data-oriented projectsOne project route is to take an interesting high-dimensional dataset and build a graphical model for it.  Some possible examples:
Spatio-temporal traffic counts or flow
Text & language data
Protein sequence & structure data
Image data (segmentation, recognition, etc.)
Sequence prediction challenge
Modeling techniquesAnother route is to explore a particular technique for building models that we have not explored in depth.
Gaussian and Gaussian-like models:
Covariance selection in Gaussian models (learning sparse inverse covariance structures)
L1-regression for variable selection, http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1152540754
Graphical Lasso, http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/graph.pdf
Gaussian copula models (Gaussian covariance with non-Gaussian marginal distributions)
http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume10/liu09a/liu09a.pdf, http://www.stat.washington.edu/research/reports/2009/tr555.pdf
Stable distribution models
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5325
Discrete models:
CDF models (model a cumulative distribution rather than a PDF)
http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume12/huang11a/huang11a.pdf
Conditional random fields
