    				Language and the EventWeb    			



Sometimes things are so obvious that you just donâ€™t see them.
In each language two important components of a sentence are nouns and verbs.  Obviously nouns are objects and verbs denote actions related to objects.  And the sentence itself represents an atomic event.  This event describes actions, and objects participating in it and other information related to the event.  SO a paragraph is really a composite event that brings together all related events that are considered similar by the author.  You can extend this analogy to the book level.  A book describes an event that comprises many events and so on.
People realized loooong ago that EventWeb is essential to communicate and share experiences.  And it was so obvious that it never was mentioned.
So people realized the importance of creating an EventWeb long time ago in text.  Now we got to do that using multimedia.
