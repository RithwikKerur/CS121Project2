	  I direct the Trustworthy Systems Lab (TrussLab).
          Our lab's research involves building trustworthy systems.
          Our projects are often at the intersection of mobile computing, security, and operating systems.
	

	  I joined the CS department at UC Irvine in July 2015.
	  I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the ECE department at Rice
	  University, and my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology.
	  Since joining UCI, I have received the NSF CAREER Award, Google's Android Security and PrIvacy REsearch (ASPIRE) Award, and UCI ICS Dean's Mid-Career Award for Research.
	


Prospective Students

	  I'm always looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students who enjoy building systems to join our lab. If you're interested, send me an email or drop by my office.
