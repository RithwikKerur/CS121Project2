    				An entrepreneurial researcher    			


NYT has a story on the third founder of Youtube who likes to remain in academia while helping found companies.
Â Mr. Karim is the third of the three founders of the video site YouTube, which Google has agreed to buy for $1.65 billion. He was present at YouTubeâ€™s creation, contributing some crucial ideas about a Web site where users could share video. But academia had more allure than the details of turning that idea into a business.
An uncommon scenario.
