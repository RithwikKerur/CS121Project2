        In March 2012 I completed a PhD in computer science with a 
concentration in Informatics for Biology and Medicine at the University
		of California, Irvine. 
         
        My advisor was Eric
	     Mjolsness. The main webpage for Eric's research group
		is Computable
            Plant.

    
	   
	  




My research interests lie within the realms of the simulation 
of biochemical reaction networks, database design and enzymatic reaction
 mechanisms. 
          My PhD dissertation focused on the schematic representation and database population strategies for Sigmoid, a biochemical network modeling tool. I also created a program, SigMech, to construct models of enzyme mechanisms. My dissertation  is available here as a 
          PDF.
