Fall 2021 Week 5: ACM x WICS x Plaid Coding Competition 

 11/29/202111/29/2021admin



On Monday, October 25, 2021, WICS partnered with ACM and Plaid to conduct a three-hour long coding competition. The competition was specifically designed to have something for all experience levels- the seasoned coders as well as the beginners. The evening started off with an introduction by WICS and ACM. Representatives from Plaid shared information about the company and its recruiting process. This was then followed by the competition kick-off. The questions ranged from easy to extremely challenging, and gave all the participants a lot to learn!
