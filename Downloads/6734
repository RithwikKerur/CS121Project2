Combatting Harassment and Discrimination



Ad hoc committee to combat harassment and discrimination in the Theory of Computing community

 Charge 

  In consultation with many of the  organizations running theory venues
  (IEEE TCMF/FOCS, ACM SIGACT/STOC+JACM, EATCS/ICALP, SIAM/SODA+SICOMP, SIGECOM, SoCG, CCCG),  a joint committee
  has been appointed to discuss and propose coordinated policies,
  procedures, and institutions to deal with harassment and related ethical issues.
  The charter of the committee is stated as follows:


"We are setting an ad-hoc committee to draft a proposal for joint ToC measures to combat discrimination,
 harassment, bullying, and retaliation, and all matters of ethics that might relate to that. Proposed
 measures may include, but are not restricted to, coordinating policies and guidelines, and setting
 community-wide institutions for reporting and oversight. The primary goal should be a determination
 to deter and root out such behavior in the theory community. The issues of false reporting and due
 process should be taken into account. The committee is expected to conduct the necessary research
 on existing practices. The committee will submit a report to the appointing organizations by September 30, 2018."

 Membership 

  Members of the ToC community should feel free to contact any member of
  the committee  if they have input they would like to share related
  to the charge.
