August 28, 2017

Forbes: “Plagued By Workplace Interruptions? Set Some Boundaries” (Mark quoted)

August 23, 2017


Interruptions at work are a pandemic. Professionals get bombarded constantly from all sides. A typical manager gets interrupted every three minutes at work, according to Gloria Mark, associate professor at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. It’s no wonder that, by the end of the day, we feel frayed but not accomplished. To make matters worse, we interrupt ourselves nearly as often as others interrupt us. Be honest: How many times each day do you find yourself checking Instagram or compulsively tidying your inbox?

NPR: “‘Schoolifying’ Minecraft Without Ruining It” (Ito quoted)

August 10, 2017


“Scrappy educators and hackers and YouTubers kept adding stuff on, and it was very much an organic, geek-led movement,” says Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist at UC Irvine who studies how children and teens use media. She is also the founder of an online Minecraft summer camp.
Ito compares the game to a skateboarding park: a place that kids flock to and have a blast while also picking up wicked cool new tricks. “Kids are mostly hanging out, but they’re also learning from each other,” she explains. “Some are more advanced and are displaying their skills, so there are open invites to level up.”

Ruberg has article featured in new Gaming Representation book




Assistant Professor of Informatics Bonnie Ruberg’s article, “Playing to Lose: The Queer Art of Failing at Video Games,” was included as a chapter in a new book titled Gaming Representation: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Video Games, which was published on July 3, 2017 by Indiana University Press. Gaming Representation examines the portrayals of race, gender and sexuality in a range of video games from casual to indie to mainstream. In their essays, the contributors to this volume argue that representation and identity function as systems in games that share a strong connection to code and platforms. The book was edited by Jennifer Malkowski, assistant professor of film and media studies at Smith College, and TreaAndrea M. Russworm, associate professor of English at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
