    				Rising wages in India starting to hurt    			


Hopfully the story mentioned here is an exception not a common occurrence.Â 

Image search firm Riya is to pull its research and engineering operations out of India to consolidate in the U.S. due toÂ rising wages in Bangalore.

There has been concerns about rising wages making India less attractive for outsourcing, but this was not expected to happen so soon.Â  Indian market became hot but the supply seems not to be able to keep up with it — education system really needs serious improvements.Â  There have been many talks about inadequate education system, but it seems that most people want to only look at IITs and IIMs.
