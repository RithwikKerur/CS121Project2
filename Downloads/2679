    				Now laptops getting phone    			


So far it was common to see that phones and PDAs were extending their functionality to include computing.  Now it appears that the trend is changing and laptops are becoming small enough to carry them everywhere and they are getting functionality of the phone.  See details in NYT by David Pogue.
I wonder when we will start seeing these devices that will bring essential functionality and will eliminate the current hard keyboard.  Tablet PC was a good step in that direction and people tell me that the handwriting recognition technology there is now good enough to really use.  SO maybe things will move rapidly in that direction.

Good things come to those ones who wait, says the proverb. At present, this is very appropriate if you’re in the market for a brand new device e.g. notebook. Unless you’re in a hurry, you may want to keep your wallet in your pocket â€” there are new technologies around the corner you won’t want to miss.
While for a few years, the pace of innovation seemed to be slowing down, the year 2008 may be different. Conversations with several experts on industry trends, and a deep dive into the conventional wisdom of published reports, have yielded some interesting prognostications.
