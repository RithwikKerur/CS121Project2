 12/16/202112/16/2021admin



This Monday, November 15, 2021, of Week 8, WICS held an In Person Game Night for the Fall quarter. It was an opportunities for members to socialize and have fun playing games. A few groups played Uno, and others played Exploding Kittens and JackBox. When a group was done, they were able to switch with other groups to have a chance at the variety of games! During the middle of the event, members were able to eat Dominos pizza and soda as a snack! The night was closed off with new friends and mentors/ mentees saying goodbye to each other or exchanging Instagram info!
