Fall Quarter 2016: Week 7: Summer Internship Panel 

 11/17/201601/07/2017Diana Sandil



This week, on November 9th, WICS hosted a “What I Learned at My Summer Internship Panel”. At the meeting, members asked any questions they may have about summer internships, and we had our wonderful panel answer the questions. On the panel, we had five undergraduate students who talked about their experiences at Northrop Grumman, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Intuit. As for our Ph.D. representative, he talked about his experiences at Google during the summer and his experience throughout his college years. WICS attendees learned about the whole process, from resumes to interviewing to all the perks and benefits as interns at these companies. Of course, pizza was provided, so everyone was well fed, happy, and left, inspired by the panelists.
