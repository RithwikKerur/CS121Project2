    				Search Steering Wheel    			


Search by John Battelle is already making waves and is getting into best seller lists.
I came to know today, through a mail from Randall Hounsell of Comcast,  that John Battelle talks about my interview and steering wheel for search in his last chapter on future of search.  Funnily, I have the book sitting on my desk for more than two weeks but I did not get time to get to it.  I am really pleased that John Battelle likes and talked about it.  In my humble opinion, that is very much needed.  Also, we are at a point in search that soon many of our traditional search techniques will need to be reconsidered.
By the way, I read about the steering wheel metaphor so I am only using it — I did not coin it.
