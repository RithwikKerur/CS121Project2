    				Best jobs — Well I am in one.    			


According to MONEY magazine the top two best jobs are software engines and Professors.
Software engineers have the best jobs in America, according to a survey released on Wednesday.
Placing second were college professors and administrators and third were financial advisors, as surveyed by Money magazine, published by Time Inc., and Salary.com, compensation experts based in Needham, Massachusetts.
Here I am a Professor in Software related areas and an entrepreneur in software, and a consultant in this.  Oh not all this is now adding up to the stress level that does not make my job the best as I initially thought.  But I have the satisfaction that I am in an area that has two best job functions.
