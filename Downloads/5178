WICS Fall Quarter Week 10: WICS Potluck 

 12/07/201812/04/2018admin



On December 3rd, Monday of Week 10, WICS hosted their quarterly ICS Potluck. Members brought delicious food from cornbread to Panda Express to Filipino spaghetti. For dessert, members also brought cookies, 85ºC bread, and candy canes. Everyone sat together around a banquet-style table, meeting and catching up with friends and other members. Members also brought and played games like Red Flag during the potluck. Thank you to everyone that joined us in wrapping up Fall Quarter! We look forward for the future events in Winter Quarter.
