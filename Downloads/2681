    				Cyber-hugs    			


It had to happen — wearable systems that could be used to give the feel of hug from distance.  This is what a researcher at NTU in Singapore has developed.  
Now it is easier to develop rendering approaches than to develop ingest approaches.  So it will be easier to give a simple feel of hug using a inflatable wearbale suit but how do we give a feel of hug by a specific person.  A hug is not just the feel of a ‘squeeze’ but it is very personal feel of specific feel at different points that correspond to the specific person.  Also, it is usually not one way squeeze but an interactive feel.  So, don’t hold your breath yet because it will be some time before you can get hug from your loved ones.
