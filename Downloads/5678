Student Groups


Our graduate students actively engage in campus life through UC Irvine’s many clubs and organizations, including the Associated Graduate Students — UCI’s officially recognized graduate student government. They also form informal reading groups, and take part in intramural sports through the Anteater Recreation Center.
One group, the Informatics Graduate Student Association (IGSA), is dedicated to all of the graduate students in the department. IGSA is run by the students themselves and, among other things, organizes a weekly coffee hour, hosts social events such as beach barbecues and game nights, and is an advocate for graduate student needs to the department.
