abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) as a non-invasive and low-cost technique plays a significant role in wearable Internet-of-Things based health monitoring systems, enabling continuous health and well-being data collection. As PPG monitoring is relatively simple, non-invasive, and convenient, it is widely used in a variety of wearable devices (e.g., smart bands, smart rings, smartphones) to acquire different vital signs such as heart rate and pulse rate variability. However, the accuracy of such vital signs highly depends on the quality of the signal and the presence of artifacts generated by other resources such as motion. This unreliable performance is unacceptable in health monitoring systems. To tackle this issue, different studies have proposed motion artifacts reduction and signal quality assessment methods. However, they merely focus on improvements in the results and signal quality. Therefore, they are unable to alleviate erroneous decision making due to invalid vital signs extracted from the unreliable PPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel PPG quality assessment approach for IoT-based health monitoring systems, by which the reliability of the vital signs extracted from PPG quality is determined. Therefore, unreliable data can be discarded to prevent inaccurate decision making and false alarms. Exploiting a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach, a hypothesis function is created by comparing heart rate in the PPG with corresponding heart rate values extracted from ECG signal. We implement a proof-of-concept IoT-based system to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Resource management strategies for many-core systems need to enable sharing of resources such as power, processing cores, and memory bandwidth while coordinating the priority and significance of system- and application-level objectives at runtime in a scalable and robust manner. State-of-the-art approaches use heuristics or machine learning for resource management, but unfortunately lack formalism in providing robustness against unexpected corner cases. While recent efforts deploy classical control-theoretic approaches with some guarantees and formalism, they lack scalability and autonomy to meet changing runtime goals. We present SPECTR, a new resource management approach for many-core systems that leverages formal supervisory control theory (SCT) to combine the strengths of classical control theory with state-of-the-art heuristic approaches to efficiently meet changing runtime goals. SPECTR is a scalable and robust control architecture and a systematic design flow for hierarchical control of many-core systems. SPECTR leverages SCT techniques such as gain scheduling to allow autonomy for individual controllers. It facilitates automatic synthesis of the high-level supervisory controller and its property verification. We implement SPECTR on an Exynos platform containing ARM's big.LITTLE-based heterogeneous multi-processor (HMP) and demonstrate that SPECTR»s use of SCT is key to managing multiple interacting resources (e.g., chip power and processing cores) in the presence of competing objectives (e.g., satisfying QoS vs. power capping). The principles of SPECTR are easily applicable to any resource type and objective as long as the management problem can be modeled using dynamical systems theory (e.g., difference equations), discrete-event dynamic systems, or fuzzy dynamics.

We propose a Gain Scheduled Controller (GSC) for nonlinear runtime power management of CMPs that simplifies the controller implementation of systems with varying dynamic properties by utilizing an adaptive control theoretic approach in conjunction with static linear controllers. Our design improves the accuracy of the controller over a static linear controller with minimal overhead. We implement our approach on an Exynos platform containing ARM's big.LITTLE-based heterogeneous multi-processor (HMP) and demonstrate that the system's response to changes in target power is improved by 2x while operating up to 12% more efficiently for tracking accuracy.Closehttps://doi.org/10.23919/DATE.2018.8342141doi:10.23919/DATE.2018.8342141Close Sagdighi, Armin;  Donyanavard, Bryan;  Kadeed, Thawra;  Moazzemi, Kasra;  Mück, Tiago;  Nassar, Ahmed;  Rahmani, Amir M;  Wild, Thomas;  Dutt, Nikil;  Ernst, Rolf;  Herkersdorf, Andreas;  Kurdahi, FadiDesign Methodologies for Enabling Self-awareness in Autonomous Systems Conference 2018 Design, Automation Test in Europe Conference Exhibition (DATE), 2018, ISSN: 1558-1101.Abstract | Links | BibTeX@conference{8342259,

However, LBC schemes induce higher computational demand compared to classic schemes (e.g., DSA, ECDSA) for equivalent security guarantees, making domain-specific acceleration a viable option for improving security and favor early adoption of LBC schemes by the semiconductor industry. In this paper, we present a workflow to explore the design space of domain-specific accelerators for LBC schemes, to target a diverse set of host devices, from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance computing platforms. We present design exploration results on workloads executing NewHope and BLISSB-I schemes accelerated by our domain-specific accelerators, with respect to a baseline without acceleration. We show that achieved performance with acceleration makes the execution of NewHope and BLISSB-I comparable to classic key exchange and digital signature schemes while retaining some form of general purpose programmability. In addition to 44% and 67% improvement in energy-delay product (EDP), we enhance performance (cycles) of the sign and verify steps in BLISSB-I schemes by 24% and 47%, respectively. Performance (EDP) improvement of server and client side of the NewHope key exchange is improved by 37% and 33% (52% and 48%), demonstrating the utility of the design space exploration framework.
