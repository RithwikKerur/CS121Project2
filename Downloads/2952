    				Multimedia Story telling    			


Story telling has always been a fascination for people — as much as listening stories and experiences.Â  A company that is trying to bring multimedia story telling is Slide, discussed in a news.com story here:

Levchin aims to make Slide the leader of a new category he describes as online storytelling through multimedia, a focus that is meant to distinguish it from many photo-sharing sites.
“When the dust settles, we should be the category definer,” he said in an interview about the site.
Growing largely through word-of-mouth recommendation, Slide ranks as the sixth-most-visited U.S. photo entertainment site, according to Web measurement firm Hitwise, attracting more visitors than sites such as Snapfish and Shutterfly.
Interesting direction.
