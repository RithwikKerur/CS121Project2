Update: back to the classroom!



 



After having served the Bren School of ICS as founding dean and before that as chair, for a total of ten years, I’m headed back to the classroom!  I had a pleasant sabbatical, some of which was spent with NCWIT and the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado–Boulder, and a lot of time was spent on various Computer Science Education activities, such as chairing CSEdWeek and CCEAN.  Now I’m ready to see what’s next.  For now, that’s being,what some might call, a POP!
