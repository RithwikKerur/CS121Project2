Posted on August 11, 2021February 16, 2022Congratulations to NSF Graduate Research Fellowship awardee Adam Birnbaum! 


Congratulations to Adam Birnbaum for earning a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship!  He is focusing his research on developing flexible methods for modeling spatiotemporal data that make fewer assumptions but are still easy to use by practitioners. “This could, for example, be used to improve our understanding of health disparities among groups of people depending on where they live or work,” he explains. “With more and more data being gathered and more and more decisions driven by those data, I’m excited to help improve our ability to understand the world through statistical methods.” 
Only 12-15 of these fellowships are awarded in Statistics each year and Adam is the fifth member of the lab to have earned such an honor. Congratulations!
