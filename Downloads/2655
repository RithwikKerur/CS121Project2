Home video is becoming popular medium to capture important moments.  The notion of ‘Kodak Moment’ is changing from capturing an experience of a ‘moment’ to really of an ‘interval’.  By capturing short videos one can capture the dynamics better and that allows, in most cases, capturing emotions better.  With ease of capture, display on screens, and inexpensive storage, short videos are likely to become as popular, possibly more popular, than photographs in very near future.
This fact is not lost on budding entrepreneurs and established companies.  Scott Kirsner has a good article on increasing number of Web sites related to video distribution in NYTimes.
