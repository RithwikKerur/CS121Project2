WICS Fall Quarter Week 4: Coffee Chat with Deloitte 

 11/04/201811/04/2018admin



On Thursday, October 25th, WICS collaborated with Deloitte Consulting, SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers), and NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers), to host an invite-only Coffee Chat event. Around 12 Deloitte practitioners came to talk to students who have applied to Deloitte Consulting’s open positions. It was a great opportunity for students to network with Deloitte practitioners and to learn more about Deloitte Consulting. They also provided coffee, donuts, and some free swag for the attendees! We’re glad we got to partner with SHPE, NSBE, and Deloitte Consulting!
