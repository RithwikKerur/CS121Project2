Mac Setup Guide

This page will guide you how to setup C++ development environment on Mac using Eclipse and how to set gdb for debugging purposes.


Setup development environment using Eclipse


1: Install ​Xcode from Mac App Store. After the installation is finished, open it and it will start installing additional necessary things.


2: Open terminal, type   xcode-select --install   Follow the prompts to let it install necessary components (Xcode Command Line Tools)


3: Download and install ​Eclipse for C/C++ for Mac OS X. We recommend using the latest version, but you don't have to. Note: for mac users who have updated to Mac OS X High Sierra, please follow the exact link to download the latest version., since it fixes a bug that won't let you run C/C++ programs in Eclipse in High Sierra.


4: Go to the deployment guide to set up the codebase for project 1. Be sure to select MacOSX GCC instead of Cross GCC.


You can check ​this page if you need more detailed instructions.


Set up GDB for debugging purposes


This process is pretty complicated, but GDB can help a lot when debugging.


Follow this Setup GDB on MacOS to set up gdb.


Set up Valgrind for debugging purposes


Valgrind is a very powerful tool to detect memory leaks in your program. As of 09/26/2018, the latest release of Valgrind (3.13.0) doesn't support MacOS 10.13 High Sierra yet, so we have to build from source on our own. Even if you use a older version of Mac, I recommend you to follow the same process.


Prerequisite:

Xcode command line tools, you should already have it if you follow step 1 and 2 of Eclipse setup guide.
Install ​Homebrew if you haven't done so. Homebrew is a powerful package management tool for Mac and everyone is highly recommended install it.

Installation:

Install git using homebrew:   brew install git 
Install automake using homebrew:  brew install automake 
Clone Valgrind's git repository:  git clone git://sourceware.org/git/valgrind.git 
cd into the valgrind folder:  cd valgrind 
run  ./autogen.sh 
run  ./configure 
run  make 
run  make install
