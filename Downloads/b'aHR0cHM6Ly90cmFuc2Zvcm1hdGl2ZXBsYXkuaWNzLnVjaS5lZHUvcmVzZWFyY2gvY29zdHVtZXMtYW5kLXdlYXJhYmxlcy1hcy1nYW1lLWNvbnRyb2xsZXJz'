Costumes and Wearables as Game Controllers 






 








Collaborators: Katherine Isbister (NYU Game Lab), Kaho Abe (NYU Game Lab, Eyebeam Collective), Anne Sullivan (Play Crafts), Luigi Anzivino (The Exploratorium)
Drawing on our theatrical background and game design, the Costumes and Wearables as Game Controllers project explores the expressive conceptual, methodological, and practical possibilities of wearable game interfaces.  The first major outcome of this collaboration is a jointly organized studio to be hosted at the TEI Conference in January of 2015.  As an interdisciplinary research initiative, this work brings together contributors and participants from game studies, human computer interaction, dance, theater, and fashion design.
