Workshop 


Brownie Troops Computer Expert Badge 

 02/17/201406/21/2014admin



On Sunday, February 9th, 6 volunteers from WICS came out to help 7 Brownie Troops with earning their Computer Expert Badge! It was an educational yet fun day for the Brownies; they got to experience using computers to paint a picture, take a virtual museum tour, play an online game, and much more! (To see more details, see their event website) This was an insightful experience for the volunteers as well, seeing that the 6-8 year old girls having a lot more knowledge on computers compared to phones; it looks like there is a new generation of Computer Scientists!
The workshop was very successful and WICS plans to do more with girl scouts in the future to continue teaching young girls about technology.
