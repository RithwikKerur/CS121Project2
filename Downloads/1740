Data Set Information:
This loop sensor data was collected for the Glendale on ramp for the 101 North freeway in Los Angeles.  It is close enough to the stadium to see unusual traffic after a Dodgers game, but not so close and heavily used by game traffic so that the signal for the extra traffic is overly obvious. NOTE: This is an on ramp near the stadium so event traffic BEGINS at or near the END of the event time. The observations were taken over 25 weeks, 288 time slices per day (5 minute count aggregates).   The goal is to predict the presence of a baseball game at Dodgers stadium 

Attribute Information:
1.  Date: MM/DD/YY2.  Time: (H)H:MM (military time)3.  Count: Number of cars measured for the previous five minutesRows: Each five minute time slice is represented by one row  For .events file:1.  Date: MM/DD/YY2.  Begin event time: HH:MM:SS (military) 3.  End event time: HH:MM:SS (military)4.  Game attendance5.  Away team6.  W/L score
