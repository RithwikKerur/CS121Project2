PmWiki /
Requirements




administrators (basic) 

Prerequisites for running the PmWiki wiki engine:
PHP 4.3 or later
PHP 5 or later is recommended
for PHP 5.5 compatibility use the current version of PmWiki
Some sort of webserver that can run PHP scripts.
PmWiki has been reported to work with the following OS/webserver combinations:
Apache 1.3 or 2.0, on roughly anything (Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X)
Apache 2.4 or later is recommended
lighttpd (1.4.19 php-fastcgi ssl) on Linux
nginx (0.8.47) on Windows
Microsoft Internet Information Server, on Windows
Linux + LiteSpeedWeb Server Standard Edition 
appWeb (a small, php-enabled webserver) executing on a Linksys NSLU2 Network Storage Link device
PmWiki has been reported not to work on:
Mac OS before Mac OS X because there's no PHP available
Specific Release Candidate builds of PHP 5.3 for Windows may not work correctly with passwords
The Standalone recipe provides a special, bare-bones webserver application that can be used to run PmWiki in places where another webserver isn't available.
PmWiki can also be run from a USB drive.
