Lecture Seventeen--Eight people stories from the dot-com
world
1. Really early midlife crisis
 
29 year old from CA goes to NY
to set up NY office for Fluid, Inc
Too much, overwhelming, no bonus
He quits and goes back to CA
"Bought into a dream, but the dream
didn't give them what they want"
Usually happens in 40-50 year olds
Young people get rich
dot-coms tank
people laid off, companies go bankrupt, nervous
Silicon Valley, no life
Too much responsibility too soon
Some turn to religion
Some go back to companies they left,
e.g., Anderson recruiting people who left

 
2. Six profiles
a. Seth, 29--PetStore.com, bust, big hi, big low
b. Cecelia, 32--E-commerce fashion consulting
too much, too busy, cut back, sister dies
c. Theo, 29--start up, too much, back to Bain
sleeping in a sleeping bag under your desk
three nights a week is really abnormal
d. Jason, 27--co-founder of .com, sold, back to school
old goal: retire by 30 w/10-20 million
e. Jeanne, 36--from PR firm to web broadcasting co
for same salary plus equity. Co. folds
f. Justin 25--tending bar, maybe grad school
to an incentive based marketing network
now teaching math to 7th graders
.com was a great experience

"... dot-coms were all golden, and now they're all dirt."
not really
Priceline now is not a growth challenge, it is a workout
she want to learn, not to earn
startups not better for women
another .com--only if she was in control
 
 


4. Morals
What is relation of downfall in .com world
to these stories?
Not enough control-- too much to do
Too much work--not enough satisfaction
Bounce back to old job

If so, how are they different?
