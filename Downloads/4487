Tsudik Awarded Visiting Professorship at TU Dresden
January 5, 2018 Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science Gene Tsudik has been awarded an honorary 2017/18 Visiting Professorship at the Technical University (TU) Dresden in Germany. The competitive position comes with a grant of about $30,000 (€25,000) from the TÜV Süd-Foundation, which has been awarding visiting professorships at TU Dresden since 2014. The visiting professorship allows renowned international scholars, such as Tsudik, to be invited to the university for a period of up to three months to contribute to the academic discourse, as well as engage in dialogue with scholars and students. This year, the foundation was looking to award the professorship to an expert in the field of security, which falls in line with Tsudik’s research interests that include privacy, computer and network security, and applied cryptography.
